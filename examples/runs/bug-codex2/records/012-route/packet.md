## You may write

- goals/G-001-dash-damage/goal.md

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record with a route plan. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the latest Handoff, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps
4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and log why under
   *Route changes*. Confirm (`planned`) or drop (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition
   this result settles. The route is a plan, not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff.
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`) and
  shares one route number with a letter suffix (2a, 2b). The Route operation waits for all of them
  before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.3: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player kit of attack
and dash. Dry-run only: "running the build" means reading `sim/build-0.3.md`.

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).
- Dry-run project: there is no real repository. `sim/repo-notes.md` stands in for the code. A Build
  step implements a change by stating it exactly in its Handoff (what changes, where, and how to
  exercise it); the change then counts as made, and the runtime's simulator updates `sim/` from it.

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.

# G-001: ダッシュ中の被ダメージ不具合を修正する

## Owner request

> ダッシュ中なのにダメージを受けることがある。再現できるので直してほしい。

## Interpretation

報告された被ダメージを再現し、仕様に反する挙動を修正して、ダッシュ時のダメージ判定が既存の仕様どおりに動くことを独立した検証で確認する。

戦闘の方向性変更、新しい入力の追加、無関係なバランス調整は対象外。

## Unknowns

- Observe: Owner が新たに体感による部分的な観察を提供した。被弾後に間をおいたダッシュ、Grub との接触、60 FPS・PC・ゲームパッドでの発生傾向が報告された。正確な時系列、独立した再現性、未観察条件は未確定。QA が既存仕様と照合し、確認可能な範囲を判断する。
- Diagnose: 技術的原因は未確定。QA の結果が独立した技術調査を必要とする場合に追加する。
- Decide: 既存仕様への修正に方向選択は不要。D-002 は不足入力を補完して修正を継続する Owner の決定であり、ゲームの方向変更ではない。
- Design: 過去の QA 報告では期待挙動と受け入れ条件は明確。入力不能中の予約入力や完全同時の境界処理は今回新たに定義しない。
- Plan: 非自明・高リスク・複数システムへの影響が判明した場合に追加する。
- Build: QA が修正に使える不具合報告と受け入れ条件を整え、必要な調査・計画を経た後に開始する。
- Verify: Build 後は必須。既存仕様、受け入れ条件、30 / 60 FPS、キーボード・ゲームパッドに照らして独立検証する。
- Play: 体験や感触の改善依頼ではないため省略。
- Review: 体験 Goal やゲームの方向 Decision を伴わないため省略。
- Next: 検証後に Studio が Owner 向けの結果と残件をまとめる。

過去の Observe の done は入力確認作業の終了を表し、再現確認の成功を表さない。1d の結果は `08-qa-to-studio.md`。今回の 1e は Owner の新しい観察を受けた再開であり、同じ資料だけの再試行ではない。Diagnose と Plan は QA の結果により必要性を判断する。

## Route changes

2026-10-10 — 初回 Observe の結果 `02-qa-to-studio.md`（outcome: question）を受領し、1 を done とした。再現条件が不足しているため追加 Observe を設けた。期待挙動の仕様不足ではないという QA の報告を受け、Design を skipped とした。

2026-10-10 — `04-qa-to-studio.md`（outcome: question）を受領し、1b を done とした。補足資料が未提供のため、資料受領を開始条件とする 1c を設けた。

2026-10-10 — `06-qa-to-studio.md`（outcome: question）を受領し、1c を done とした。資料受領を開始条件とする 1d を設け、実行環境側の補完を待つ方針とした。当時は Owner escalation を行わなかった。

2026-10-10 — `08-qa-to-studio.md`（outcome: question）を受領し、1d を done とした。QA Role・Skill 等の基本資料は補完されたが、繰り返し求めている補足観察資料と実行環境側の回答は依然未提供で、追加再現確認は未開始。

同じ不足入力について、新しい該当資料がないまま question が二回以上返った場合は Role に再投入せず Owner にエスカレーションするという `studio/orchestration.md#loop-limits` を適用した。基本資料の補完は、当該観察資料の不足解消には当たらない。過去の待機・再ルーティング方針を修正し、`09-studio-to-owner.md` に必要入力と選択肢をまとめ、Goal を blocked-on-owner とした。提供不能とは断定せず、Build や検証合格へ進めなかった。

2026-10-10 — Owner が Option A を選び、新しい観察を提供した。選択と回答原文を `decisions/D-002-resume-with-owner-observations.md` に記録し、09 を resolved、Goal を active とした。Option A の帰結に従い Observe 1e を追加し、`10-studio-to-qa.md` を open とした。体感による時刻や頻度を計測値とせず、部分資料から判断可能な範囲を QA に委ねる。残る技術調査・計画の必要性は未確定で、修正と独立検証は引き続き必要。

## Next action

新しい executor で QA が `10-studio-to-qa.md` とその Load 資料から Observe を開始する。Owner の補足観察、既存仕様、模擬ビルドを照合し、不具合報告と受け入れ条件、確認済み・未確認の範囲を Studio に返す。

必要資料の本文が次の packet に欠ける場合は欠落を明記し、結果を創作しない。Studio は QA の結果から残るルートを決める。同じ不足入力のまま待機用 Observe を繰り返さない。

## Outcome

未完了。D-002 により、補足観察を使って元の修正 Goal を継続することが決まった。Owner 入力待ちは解消し、QA の追加 Observe を開始できる状態にした。独立した再現確認、修正、修正後の検証はまだ完了していない。

# 11: qa → studio — ダッシュ中被ダメージの仕様不一致と修正受け入れ条件

## Task

本報告を基に、既存仕様を維持する修正の技術調査・計画へルーティングする。修正後は更新された模擬ビルドを独立した QA に渡し、下記の受け入れ条件を検証する。

## Context

G-001 は「ダッシュ中なのにダメージを受けることがある」という不具合の修正である。D-002 により Owner の部分的な観察を使って継続することが決まった。

今回は `studio/skills/reproduce-defect.md` に従い、Owner の観察、`design/combat.md`、`sim/build-0.3.md` を照合した。dry-run のためビルド実行に相当する作業は模擬資料の読解であり、新しい実測や試行は行っていない。Observe の評価完了であり、修正完了・Verify 合格ではない。

## Findings

### 不具合報告

**件名:** 被弾後のダッシュ中に再度ダメージを受けることがある。

**仕様上の期待結果:** `design/combat.md` の Player kit は、ダッシュを 0.25 秒、その全時間を無敵と定義している。先行する被弾の有無にかかわらず、ダッシュが継続している間の Grub 接触や Spitter 弾の命中によってハートが減ってはならない。被弾時は 1 ハート減少、0.3 秒の入力不能、その後は被弾から 0.8 秒まで無敵となる。

**実際の結果と根拠:**

| 根拠 | 得られた情報 | 確認の限界 |
|---|---|---|
| `sim/build-0.3.md` 末尾のプレイヤー観察 | 被弾直後にダッシュすると、ときどきダッシュ途中でダメージを受けると明記されている | 敵種、入力方式、FPS、イベント時刻、頻度は不明 |
| Owner の観察（D-002） | 部屋1〜2、PC・60 FPS・ゲームパッド。Grub に噛まれ、硬直終了後に少し待ってダッシュすると、後半で別の Grub に接触して 1 ハート減少 | 被弾から約 0.5〜0.8 秒、約 10 回中 6 回はいずれも体感・概数 |
| Owner の比較観察（D-002） | 被弾直後すぐのダッシュと未被弾時のダッシュでは発生を観察していない | 比較試行数と実際のダッシュ開始時刻が不明。非発生の保証ではない |
| Owner の追加観察（D-002） | Spitter 弾でも 1 回あった | 部屋、タイミング、先行被弾源などの詳細は不明 |

模擬資料だけからも「ダッシュ途中の被ダメージ」と「全ダッシュ時間無敵」の仕様不一致を確認できる。一方、Owner の詳細条件を独立した試行で再現したとは判断しない。最小の安定再現手順と発生境界は未確定である。

模擬資料の「被弾直後」と Owner の「硬直終了後に少し待つ」は、同じタイミングを意味するとは限らない。どちらも正確な時刻がなく、比較条件の一致や矛盾の解消まではできない。

**重大度:** プレイ体験を損なう。仕様上安全な回避行動中にハートを失い、回避の信頼性に影響する。進行不能を示す資料はない。頻度は模擬資料の「ときどき」と Owner の概数のみで、測定済みの発生率はない。

### 後続で実施する再現・比較手順

以下は検証手順であり、実施済みの結果ではない。

1. PC・60 FPS・ゲームパッドで、部屋1〜2の Grub 接触を対象にする。ダッシュが使用可能な状態とハート数を記録する。
2. Grub に噛まれて初回の 1 ハート減少を確認する。初回被弾、入力不能終了、ダッシュ入力・実際の開始、再接触、ダッシュ終了とハート変化を区別して記録する。
3. 入力可能になってから少し待ち、Owner の体感範囲である被弾後約 0.5〜0.8 秒を探索対象としてダッシュする。別の Grub とダッシュ中に接触する配置を用いる。総敵数、位置、方向、実際の開始時刻を記録する。
4. 先行被弾後の待ち時間だけを変え、入力可能になった直後にダッシュする比較を行う。入力不能中の予約操作は前提にしない。
5. 先行被弾がない状態でもダッシュ中に Grub と接触する比較を行う。
6. 命中源を Spitter 弾に変えて同じ比較を行う。先行被弾源は別途記録し、Owner の詳細条件が判明したとは扱わない。
7. 各条件を PC の 30 / 60 FPS とキーボード・ゲームパッドの全4組合せで確認する。各試行の条件・回数・発生数を残す。

比較対象でもダッシュ中の接触・命中を確認する。攻撃が届かなかった試行だけでは、無敵の検証にはならない。

### 修正の受け入れ条件

以下は `design/combat.md` に基づく。全条件を PC・30 / 60 FPS・キーボード / ゲームパッドで検証する。現時点の判定はすべて未検証。

| ID | 条件・操作 | プレイヤーから観察できる期待結果 |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | 被弾していない状態でダッシュし、Grub 接触／Spitter 弾命中を受ける | ダッシュ中はハートが減らない |
| AC-2 | 被弾後、0.3 秒の入力不能が終了してから直ちにダッシュし、接触／弾命中を受ける | 実際のダッシュ中はハートが減らない |
| AC-3 | 被弾後に間をおいてダッシュし、ダッシュ途中で被弾後 0.8 秒を経過する条件を作る。その経過後かつダッシュ終了前に接触／弾命中を受ける | ダッシュ後半もハートが減らない |
| AC-4 | ダッシュ終了後も被弾後 0.8 秒までの無敵時間が残る条件で、終了後かつ無敵時間内に接触／弾命中を受ける | ハートが減らない |
| AC-5 | ダッシュ中でも被弾後の無敵時間中でもない状態で Grub に接触する | 通常どおり 1 ハート減り、0.3 秒入力不能となる。その後、被弾から 0.8 秒までは追加のハート減少がない |
| AC-6 | 通常のダッシュとダッシュ中の攻撃入力を確認する | 4 タイルを 0.25 秒で移動し、クールダウン 0.6 秒を維持する。ダッシュ中の攻撃は終了時に発動する |

AC-3 の検証用設定例は「被弾後 0.7 秒にダッシュ開始、0.85 秒に命中」である。仕様上のダッシュ終了は 0.95 秒となるため、被弾由来の無敵終了後にもダッシュ中の保護を検証できる。これは仕様から算出した予定条件であり、Owner の計測値や実施結果ではない。各 FPS で実際のイベント順序を確認し、完全同時の境界は避ける。

入力不能中の予約入力、ダッシュ開始・終了と命中が完全同時の場合の優先順位は、この受け入れ条件で新たに定義しない。それらの判断が修正や検証に必要になった場合は game-designer へ戻す。

### 解消した不足と具体的な残件

**解消した事項:**

- 必須の戦闘仕様と模擬ビルド本文が揃い、期待結果と既知の仕様不一致を照合できた。
- Owner の追加観察から、優先調査条件、比較条件、環境、主な命中源を設定できた。
- 修正へ渡す不具合報告と受け入れ条件を作成できた。追加の Owner 計測を Observe 再開の必須条件とする必要はない。

**技術調査・計画に残る事項:**

- 実装原因と変更箇所は未確認。担当 Role が `sim/repo-notes.md` 等の実装資料から調査する必要がある。本 packet に同資料はなく、QA は原因や方式を断定しない。
- 安定再現に必要な配置・時刻と発生境界は未確定。技術調査と後続の模擬検証で扱い、既存資料から得られる測定値として補完しない。
- Spitter の詳細、30 FPS、キーボードは未確認。修正後の検証対象に含める。
- Verify には、変更を反映した模擬ビルドと、各受け入れ条件を評価できる観察資料が必要。資料が結果を示さない項目は合格にしない。

**ルーティング判断:** 不具合報告は修正の技術調査・計画へ渡せる。QA の追加 Observe を同じ資料で繰り返す必要はない。ただし本報告だけでは具体的な Build 変更内容は定まっていないため、Studio は担当 Role に実装資料を渡して調査・計画を進める。修正を実施した、または合格したという判断ではない。

## Decisions already made

- `decisions/D-002-resume-with-owner-observations.md`: 部分的な観察を使って元の修正 Goal を継続する。仕様変更や修正完了の承認ではない。
- 既存の入力制約: Owner 承認なく攻撃・ダッシュ・ポーズ以外の入力を追加しない。

## Constraints

- 既存仕様の不具合修正に限定し、戦闘の方向性変更や無関係なバランス調整はしない。
- Owner の体感、模擬資料の記述、今後の検証結果を区別する。
- QA は実装を変更せず、原因や修正方式を決定しない。
- 仕様未定義の境界処理が必要になった場合は game-designer に判断を返す。

## Open questions

- 技術担当は、既存の実装資料から修正箇所と変更内容を特定できるか。
- 後続の模擬ビルドで、AC-1〜AC-6 と全4環境組合せの観察結果をどのように提供するか。

現時点で Owner に追加回答を求めなければ調査へ進めない質問はない。

## Expected output

Studio が技術調査・計画へルーティングし、必要な実装資料を次の packet に含める。その後、具体的な変更内容と検証手順を備えた Build、更新済み模擬ビルドを用いる独立した Verify へ進める。
