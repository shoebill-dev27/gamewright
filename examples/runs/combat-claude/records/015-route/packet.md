## You may write

- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/goal.md
- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/12-art-director-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to)

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record with a route plan. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the latest Handoff, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps
4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and log why under
   *Route changes*. Confirm (`planned`) or drop (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition
   this result settles. The route is a plan, not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff.
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`) and
  shares one route number with a letter suffix (2a, 2b). The Route operation waits for all of them
  before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.3: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player kit of attack
and dash. Dry-run only: "running the build" means reading `sim/build-0.3.md`.

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.

# G-001: 戦闘の単調さの改善

## Owner request

> 戦闘が単調なので改善したい

## Interpretation

体験上の Goal。ビルド 0.3 の戦闘が、想定プレイヤー(短時間で濃いランを求め、回避と間合いに慣れたアクション好き)にとって単調に感じられない状態にする。
成功条件は質的なもので、プレイヤーが戦闘中に、ほぼ同じ行動の繰り返しではなく、状況に応じた位置取り・タイミング・敵の挙動への対応といった判断を実感できること。数値基準は Design の受け入れ基準で、最終判定は Review で決める。

範囲外:
- 新しい入力ボタンの追加(D-001 により Owner 承認なしでは不可)。
- 戦闘以外のシステムの変更。
- ラン長(15–20分)やビジョンの柱の変更。
- 原因の特定前に解決策を決めること。

## Unknowns

Project Context の確認結果:
- ビジョンの柱 1「ワンボタン戦闘」(D-001)は、攻撃とダッシュだけのキットで、深みは位置取り・タイミング・敵の挙動から生むと定めている。「単調」の解決策はこの枠内に収める必要がある。
- 現状はビルド 0.3(5部屋、敵2種、攻撃とダッシュ)。
- 即時エスカレーションは不要。Goal は再解釈を要さず、ビジョンや既存の Decision と衝突しない。ただし方向の決定で D-001 の変更や新ボタンが必要と分かれば、その時点でエスカレーションする。

各ステージの入口の問い:
- Observe: 単調さを実際にプレイして観察したか → 観察済み(Handoff 02)。ただし被弾直後のダッシュ中ダメージの疑い(問題 D)は未再現で、`qa` による再現が必要。
- Diagnose: 原因は分かっているか → 診断済み(Handoff 04。主因は敵挙動が各1種類で単純なこと(P1)と、部屋構成に進行がないこと(P2))。感触・実時間・演出・数値に関わる仮説 H1〜H4 は未確認。
- Decide: 方向・優先度・スコープの本当の選択があるか → あった。診断が D-001 の枠内の3案(敵の挙動 / 部屋の構成 / プレイヤー数値)を示し、`game-director` が D-002 で決めた(主軸は部屋の構成と進行、併用は予告つき Grub 突進の1つのみ)。
- Design: 意図する挙動は仕様化済みか → 戦闘仕様は `design/combat.md` に仕様化済みで、技術確認で出た食い違い 3 点も D-005 で解消済み(Handoff 10)。突進の予告の見た目は未仕様(`art-director`、5b)。
- Plan: 技術的アプローチは非自明か → 実現性確認は完了(Handoff 08、D-004)。
- Build: ゲームを変更する必要があるか → ある(D-002)。
- Verify: Build の後は常に必要。
- Play: Goal は遊び心地に関する → 変更後に必要。H1〜H4 の実機確認もここで行う。
- Review: 体験の Goal かつ方向 Decision がある → 必要。

スキップしたステージ: なし。

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. Handoff: the incoming Handoff that starts the
step. Parallel steps: 2a, 2b. Step numbers need not
match Handoff seq numbers. The route is a plan; the Route operation revises it.

## Route changes

- Step 1(Observe)の後: プレイテスターの観察報告(Handoff 02)は、体験の問題 A〜C(毎部屋同じ型、緊張感の欠如、ダッシュが戦闘で使われない)と、不具合の疑い D(被弾直後のダッシュ中にダメージを受けることがある)を報告した。計画どおり Diagnose(2a)に進む。
- 追加: 2b として `qa` による D の再現(`reproduce-defect`)を加えた。理由: D は仕様と食い違うか明らかな不具合の疑いであり、戻りルール(Play の結果が欠陥なら Observe は `qa`)に従う。2a の診断と互いの出力を使わない。
- 2a(Diagnose)の後: 診断(Handoff 04)は D-001 の枠内の3案を示し、方向・優先度・スコープの本当の選択があるため Decide(3)を確定し `open` にした。エスカレーションは不要と判断した。
- 3(Decide)の後: `game-director` が D-002 を記録した(主軸は案2の部屋の構成と進行、併用は予告つき Grub 突進の1つのみ。Spitter の変化、新しい敵、プレイヤー側の数値調整、キット変更は扱わない)。D-001 とビジョンの柱の範囲内で、新ボタンも不要なため、エスカレーションは発動しない。計画どおり Design(4)に進む。
- 3 の後の route 改訂: (a) Decide が実装前の実現性確認を求めたため、Plan(5a)を `planned` に確定した。(b) 突進の予告の見た目は `art-director` の範囲であり、Director も仕様後に回すと指示したため、Design(5b)を新設した。仕様が書き上がってから、5a と 5b を互いに独立なステップとして Handoff する(並列可。どちらも相手の出力を使わない)。(c) ゲーム変更が決まったため、Build(6)は `planned`、Verify(7)、Play(8)、Review(9)も `planned` に確定した。視覚要素(予告)が入るため、Verify は `art-director` の `visual-review` を並列に加える。
- 欠陥 D は、Director の指示どおり今回の戦闘仕様に含めない。2b の再現結果が出てから、ダッシュと被弾後の無敵の規則を設計書に書き足す。2b の Handoff は、Owner の報告と設計文書のみを `qa` に渡す必要がある。報告文の原文は後続の Studio 操作で用意し、推測で書かない。
- Handoff 05 の編集(Route 手順 4–5): `stage` を `Specify` から開発ループの用語である `Design` に直した。Load に、受け手の Works from に合う `project.md#player-profile`(ゲームパッド主体のプレイヤー)と、元の観察である Handoff 02 を追加した。`Sender assessment` は触っていない。
- 観察と診断は `sim/build-0.3.md` と `design/combat.md` に基づくドライランであり、ゲームパッドの操作感・実時間・演出・数値(H1〜H4)は未確認。仕様の数値は暫定値として扱い、Play の確認後に調整する。
- 4(Design)の後: 仕様(Handoff 06)は計画どおりで、方向・優先度・スコープの選択は出ておらず、エスカレーションも発動しない(D-001、D-002 の範囲内。新ボタンなし)。Design(4)を `done` にし、Plan(5a)を `open` にした。
- 5a と 5b の Handoff について: 5a と 5b は独立で並列にできる(連続する seq で、route 番号に文字の接尾辞)。この Route 操作で書けるのは seq 7 の Handoff 1 つだけだったため、5a の Handoff(07)を先に作り、5b の Handoff は後続の Studio 操作が作る。5b の入力は `design/combat.md` §10 と `project.md#art-direction` で、`game-designer` の Sender assessment は渡さない。Handoff 06 が指示するとおり、Playtester に渡す Handoff には仕様の数値や §6.2 の体験の観点を書かない。
- 5a の Handoff(07)は Handoff 06 の Findings(客観的な仕様の内容)から Studio が組み立てた。`game-designer` の Sender assessment(確信度、暫定値の根拠)は技術計画に不要なので含めていない。
- 5a(Plan)の後: 技術計画(Handoff 08、D-004)は、仕様が D-001〜D-003 と制約の範囲で実現できると結論した。コードは読まず `sim/` の記述に基づく見積もりで、部屋データ、スポナー、弾の衝突、接触の判定形状は Build の最初の作業 T0 で確認する。`outcome: question` ではないため、Plan の戻りルール(仕様が実現不能)は適用しない。エスカレーションの条件(コンセプト・柱・Decision の変更、スコープ・費用・リスクの大幅な変化、不可逆な変更)にも当たらないと判断した。
- 5a の後の route 改訂: 技術側が仕様の文面と既存実装の食い違いを 3 点(怯みの扱い、接触の定義、部屋 5 の FL/FR)見つけ、仕様側の決定が要るため、Design(5c、`game-designer`)を新設して `open` にした(Handoff 09)。これは仕様の解釈であり、技術側は決められない。Build は 5b と 5c の両方の後に進める。5c は 5b と互いの出力を使わないので並列にできる。5c の答えが D-002 や D-003 の変更、スコープの変更を要する場合は、`game-designer` が `question` で返し、Decide(`game-director`)に回す。
- Handoff 09 の作り方(Route 手順 4–5): 受け手 `game-designer` の Works from(仕様の質問、Decision、設計文書)に合わせ、Handoff 08 の Findings から確認依頼 1〜3 と既定 4、判断材料の技術的事実だけを抜き出した。Handoff 08 の Sender assessment(欠陥 D の仮説を含む)は渡していない。欠陥 D の仮説は `qa` の再現に先入観を与えるため、2b の Handoff にも含めない。
- Handoff 08 は編集していない(受け手は Studio で、Load は Studio の routing のため)。
- Build が T2 と T3 を並列にする条件は、T0 で部屋のコードと敵のコントローラが別モジュールだと確認できること。Build の Handoff を作るときに、この条件と T0 で前提が崩れたときの Studio への戻しを Expected output に書く。Handoff 08 のとおり、開発用補助(部屋の選択、突進スイッチ、30/60 FPS 切り替え、状態の遷移ログ)は開発ビルド限定で、プレイヤー向けの新しい入力は足さない。
- 5c(Design)の後: 仕様の確認(Handoff 10、D-005)は D-001〜D-003 の範囲内で決まり、`outcome: done`。方向・優先度・スコープの変更も新ボタンもなく、エスカレーションの条件に当たらない。`game-director` に回す必要もない。5c を `done` にした。Handoff 10 の質問「欠陥 D の規則の追記」は 2b の結果待ちで、Build の前提ではない。
- 5c の後の次の操作: Build は 5b の後という計画を変えない。残る前提は 5b だけなので、Handoff 11 で `art-director` に 5b を始める。Handoff 11 は、受け手 `art-director` の Works from(設計仕様の視覚的含意、美術方針と制約)に合わせて Studio が組み立てた。Handoff 10 の Findings のうち視覚に関わる客観的な事実(怯まない 3 状態、接触の解決の仕方)だけを抜き出し、`game-designer` の Sender assessment と実装側への影響(Playtester・art に不要)は渡していない。`design/combat.md` §10 の本文はこの操作の入力になかったため、Handoff 11 では要約せず Load で指定した。Previous handoff を none にしたのは、Handoff 10 に Sender assessment が含まれ、5b の方針(渡さない)に反するため。
- 2b(欠陥 D の `qa`)の Handoff は今回も作っていない。理由: この操作で書けるのは seq 11 の 1 つで、5b の方が Build を止めている前提になる。2b は Build を止めず、独立している(Build の前に結果があれば、欠陥修正を Build に加える)。Owner の報告の原文が入力にないため、推測で書かない。
- Build の Handoff を作るときの条件(Route 手順 4–5 のため記録): 5b の結果(視覚要素の一覧、既存の仕組みで足りるかの見立て)と `design/combat.md`、D-004、D-005 を渡す。Handoff 10 の「実装側への影響」(解決済みフラグ、除外状態、遠い方の選択はデータの規則)は技術情報として `gameplay-engineer` に渡してよいが、Sender assessment は渡さない。

## Next action

Studio は Route を終えて停止する。次の操作は 2 つ(互いに独立)。
1. 人間が Handoff `goals/G-001-combat-monotony/11-studio-to-art-director.md` から `art-director`(Design、`write-design-spec`、`make-decision`)のステップを開始する。成果は `design/` 内の視覚仕様と、`to: studio` 宛ての Handoff。規則や数値の変更が必要なら `outcome: question` で返す。
2. Studio が 2b(`qa`、`reproduce-defect`)の Handoff `NN-studio-to-qa.md`(次の空き seq、12 以降)を作る Route 操作を行う。Owner の報告の原文と設計文書のみを渡し、プレイテスターや技術側の推測は含めない。5b と並行してよい。

その後の予定: 5b が終わったら、Studio が Route を行い、Build(`gameplay-engineer`)に進む。Build は T0 調査から始める。

Owner への報告(日本語):
- 仕様の食い違い 3 点(怯み、突進の接触の数え方、部屋 5 の出現位置の規則)は、設計側で決まった(D-005)。D-001〜D-003 の範囲内で、新ボタンも要らず、Owner の判断は要らない。
- 突進の接触は、突進ごとに最初に重なった瞬間に 1 回だけ判定する。ダッシュの回避の猶予は 0.25 秒のまま変えない。実機でダッシュが「使える」と感じられるかは、プレイテストで確認する。
- 次に `art-director` が突進の予告の見た目を決める。並行して、被弾直後のダッシュ中のダメージの疑いを `qa` が再現する。その後に実装、QA、プレイテストへ進む。
- ゲームパッドの操作感や実時間は未確認のドライラン上の判断で、実機の確認後に調整する。

# 12: art-director → studio — Grub 突進の予告の視覚仕様を書いた

## Task

`design/grub-charge-telegraph.md` と D-006 を確認し、Build に回す。`design/combat.md` §10 から視覚仕様への参照を追記する作業を、書き込めるロール(`game-designer`)に回す。

## Context

Goal G-001。Handoff 11 の依頼で、予告つき Grub 突進の「見た目」(Windup の予告、方向の示し方、Charge、Recovery の読み取り)を、player-observable な受け入れ基準を持つ仕様にした。戦闘の規則と数値は変えていない。

## Findings

- 成果は `design/grub-charge-telegraph.md`(視覚仕様、受け入れ基準、要素の一覧、費用の見立て、未確認の点)と、`decisions/D-006-grub-charge-telegraph-visual.md`(後の工程を縛る割り当て)。
- **要点**:
  - 主な合図は、足元から固定方向へ伸びる地面のレーン(赤橙の帯、縁取り、矢印)。幅は接触判定と一致、長さは 7.0 タイルまたは壁まで。不透明度は Windup の間に 35%→100% に上がる。
  - 補助は、体の沈み込み、背中の尾根(熾火)の点灯、目の光。色だけ・音だけに頼らない。
  - 方向は、レーンの向きで示す。
  - Charge: 体を進行方向に伸ばし、残像と土煙。レーンは通過した後ろ側から消える。
  - Recovery: 熾火を消し、沈んだ色と蒸気で「止まっていて攻撃が通る」と読ませる。最後の 0.2 s で姿勢が戻る。
  - 被弾は白いフラッシュと火花だけ。怯みの動きは使わない(D-005、§10)。
  - 赤橙は害になる状態だけに使う。出現中は淡い青の半透明と輪。突進型は消灯した尾根で常時区別する。
  - 全部の変化は、状態の経過割合から求める。30/60 FPS で同じ長さに見える。
- **戦闘の規則の変更は不要**と判断した。`outcome: question` にはしていない。ただし、0.7 s の予告で読んでダッシュするのに足りるかは、実機で確認するまで未確認(足りなければ規則の問題で、`game-designer` の判断)。

### Build で gameplay-engineer が必要とする視覚要素(詳細は §11)

- 必須: (1)状態、経過割合、突進方向の取得、(2)地面のレーン(半透明の帯、縁取り、矢印)、(3)スプライトの色変調、拡大縮小、描画ずらし、(4)熾火の尾根の重ね絵、(5)被弾の白いフラッシュ、(6)出現中の半透明と青い輪。
- 望ましい: (7)残像・土煙・蒸気の粒子、(8)敵に HP 表示がなければ傷の重ね絵、(9)接触の結果(無敵で抜けた/被弾)の通知(抜けた合図と使用済み表示に使う)。
- あれば: (10)音(溜め音、息の音。音が予定範囲にある場合のみ)。

### 既存の仕組みで足りるかの見立て

- 新しい大きなアセットは不要。小さな新規素材は、矢印 1 枚、尾根の重ね絵、必要なら傷の重ね絵と粒子 1 種。
- 要素 1〜6 は、既存のスプライトと演出の再利用が中心で小さい見込み。ただし**既存の仕組みは未確認**で、T0 で次を確認してほしい: 地面層に半透明の帯を描けるか、スプライトの色変調と変形ができるか、重ね絵ができるか、敵の HP 表示と被弾フラッシュの有無、既存の出現演出、粒子、Spitter の弾の色。
- 要素 3 が使えない場合の縮小案、要素 2 の代替案は §11 に書いた。要素 7〜9 は省いても必須は成立する。
- 要素 9(接触の結果の通知)が D-004 の「見た目への口」に含まれない場合は、技術側で追加できるか判断してほしい。追加しないなら、§6 の使用済み表示と §9 の抜けた合図を省く。

### 実機で確認すべき点(詳細は §12)

- レーンの赤橙と Spitter の弾の色、ランタンの光との区別(形で区別する前提)。
- 最も暗い床で、Windup の開始時点(不透明度 35%)のレーンが読めるか。
- 小さい画面とゲームパッドで、0.7 s の予告を読んでダッシュまで入力できるか。
- Recovery の沈んだ見た目が、「死にかけ」「無敵」と誤読されないか。
- レーンの幅を接触判定に一致させたとき、「かすった」の感じ方が不自然でないか。
- 抜けた合図が過剰でないか。尾根の差が小さい画面で見分けられるか。
- 30 FPS と 60 FPS で同じに読めるか。色覚の差でも形と沈み込みで読めるか。

## Decisions already made

- D-001〜D-005(前提)。
- D-006(新規): 予告は「地面のレーン + 熾火の点灯 + 沈み込み」。赤橙は害になる状態だけに使う。突進型は尾根で区別する。被弾は白いフラッシュで怯みの動きを使わない。

## Constraints

- 戦闘の規則と数値は変えていない。`design/combat.md` は、書き込める範囲外のため編集していない。
- 色の値は暫定値で、Spitter の弾の色などを確認してから調整してよい(方針は変えない)。

## Open questions

- `design/combat.md` §10 に、`design/grub-charge-telegraph.md` への参照を追記する必要がある(書き込める範囲は `game-designer`)。
- T0 の結果、必須の要素が既存の仕組みで実現できない場合は、`art-director` に戻して仕様を調整する。
- 要素 9 を「見た目への口」に含めるかは `technical-director` / `gameplay-engineer` の判断。

## Expected output

- Studio は、この Handoff と視覚仕様、D-006 を確認し、Build(T0 を含む)に回す。
- 実機の読み取りやすさの確認は Play で行う。`design/grub-charge-telegraph.md` §10.2 の体験の観点は、Playtester の handoff に書かない。

## Sender assessment

- 規則の問題を含まず、見た目だけで解けると判断した。確信度は中。レーンの幅と判定の一致、色の区別、暗い床での 35% の読み取りは、実機の確認が必要。
- 最も費用がかかるのは要素 3(変形)と 4(重ね絵)が既存の仕組みで使えない場合。縮小案を用意してある。
