## You may write

- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/goal.md
- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/14-gameplay-engineer-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to)
- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/15-studio-to-<role>.md

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record with a route plan. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the latest Handoff, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps
4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and log why under
   *Route changes*. Confirm (`planned`) or drop (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition
   this result settles. The route is a plan, not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff.
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`) and
  shares one route number with a letter suffix (2a, 2b). The Route operation waits for all of them
  before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.3: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player kit of attack
and dash. Dry-run only: "running the build" means reading `sim/build-0.3.md`.

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.

# G-001: 戦闘の単調さの改善

## Owner request

> 戦闘が単調なので改善したい

## Interpretation

体験上の Goal。ビルド 0.3 の戦闘が、想定プレイヤー(短時間で濃いランを求め、回避と間合いに慣れたアクション好き)にとって単調に感じられない状態にする。
成功条件は質的なもので、プレイヤーが戦闘中に、ほぼ同じ行動の繰り返しではなく、状況に応じた位置取り・タイミング・敵の挙動への対応といった判断を実感できること。数値基準は Design の受け入れ基準で、最終判定は Review で決める。

範囲外:
- 新しい入力ボタンの追加(D-001 により Owner 承認なしでは不可)。
- 戦闘以外のシステムの変更。
- ラン長(15–20分)やビジョンの柱の変更。
- 原因の特定前に解決策を決めること。

## Unknowns

Project Context の確認結果:
- ビジョンの柱 1「ワンボタン戦闘」(D-001)は、攻撃とダッシュだけのキットで、深みは位置取り・タイミング・敵の挙動から生むと定めている。「単調」の解決策はこの枠内に収める必要がある。
- 現状はビルド 0.3(5部屋、敵2種、攻撃とダッシュ)。
- 即時エスカレーションは不要。Goal は再解釈を要さず、ビジョンや既存の Decision と衝突しない。ただし方向の決定で D-001 の変更や新ボタンが必要と分かれば、その時点でエスカレーションする。

各ステージの入口の問い:
- Observe: 単調さを実際にプレイして観察したか → 観察済み(Handoff 02)。ただし被弾直後のダッシュ中ダメージの疑い(問題 D)は未再現で、`qa` による再現が必要。
- Diagnose: 原因は分かっているか → 診断済み(Handoff 04。主因は敵挙動が各1種類で単純なこと(P1)と、部屋構成に進行がないこと(P2))。感触・実時間・演出・数値に関わる仮説 H1〜H4 は未確認。
- Decide: 方向・優先度・スコープの本当の選択があるか → あった。診断が D-001 の枠内の3案(敵の挙動 / 部屋の構成 / プレイヤー数値)を示し、`game-director` が D-002 で決めた(主軸は部屋の構成と進行、併用は予告つき Grub 突進の1つのみ)。
- Design: 意図する挙動は仕様化済みか → 戦闘仕様は `design/combat.md` に仕様化済みで、技術確認で出た食い違い 3 点も D-005 で解消済み(Handoff 10)。突進の予告の見た目も `design/grub-charge-telegraph.md` と D-006 で仕様化済み(Handoff 12)。
- Plan: 技術的アプローチは非自明か → 実現性確認は完了(Handoff 08、D-004)。
- Build: ゲームを変更する必要があるか → ある(D-002)。
- Verify: Build の後は常に必要。
- Play: Goal は遊び心地に関する → 変更後に必要。H1〜H4 の実機確認もここで行う。
- Review: 体験の Goal かつ方向 Decision がある → 必要。

スキップしたステージ: なし。

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. Handoff: the incoming Handoff that starts the
step. Parallel steps: 2a, 2b. Step numbers need not
match Handoff seq numbers. The route is a plan; the Route operation revises it.

## Route changes

- Step 1(Observe)の後: プレイテスターの観察報告(Handoff 02)は、体験の問題 A〜C(毎部屋同じ型、緊張感の欠如、ダッシュが戦闘で使われない)と、不具合の疑い D(被弾直後のダッシュ中にダメージを受けることがある)を報告した。計画どおり Diagnose(2a)に進む。
- 追加: 2b として `qa` による D の再現(`reproduce-defect`)を加えた。理由: D は仕様と食い違うか明らかな不具合の疑いであり、戻りルール(Play の結果が欠陥なら Observe は `qa`)に従う。2a の診断と互いの出力を使わない。
- 2a(Diagnose)の後: 診断(Handoff 04)は D-001 の枠内の3案を示し、方向・優先度・スコープの本当の選択があるため Decide(3)を確定し `open` にした。エスカレーションは不要と判断した。
- 3(Decide)の後: `game-director` が D-002 を記録した(主軸は案2の部屋の構成と進行、併用は予告つき Grub 突進の1つのみ。Spitter の変化、新しい敵、プレイヤー側の数値調整、キット変更は扱わない)。D-001 とビジョンの柱の範囲内で、新ボタンも不要なため、エスカレーションは発動しない。計画どおり Design(4)に進む。
- 3 の後の route 改訂: (a) Decide が実装前の実現性確認を求めたため、Plan(5a)を `planned` に確定した。(b) 突進の予告の見た目は `art-director` の範囲であり、Director も仕様後に回すと指示したため、Design(5b)を新設した。仕様が書き上がってから、5a と 5b を互いに独立なステップとして Handoff する(並列可。どちらも相手の出力を使わない)。(c) ゲーム変更が決まったため、Build(6)は `planned`、Verify(7)、Play(8)、Review(9)も `planned` に確定した。視覚要素(予告)が入るため、Verify は `art-director` の `visual-review` を並列に加える。
- 欠陥 D は、Director の指示どおり今回の戦闘仕様に含めない。2b の再現結果が出てから、ダッシュと被弾後の無敵の規則を設計書に書き足す。2b の Handoff は、Owner の報告と設計文書のみを `qa` に渡す必要がある。報告文の原文は後続の Studio 操作で用意し、推測で書かない。
- Handoff 05 の編集(Route 手順 4–5): `stage` を `Specify` から開発ループの用語である `Design` に直した。Load に、受け手の Works from に合う `project.md#player-profile`(ゲームパッド主体のプレイヤー)と、元の観察である Handoff 02 を追加した。`Sender assessment` は触っていない。
- 観察と診断は `sim/build-0.3.md` と `design/combat.md` に基づくドライランであり、ゲームパッドの操作感・実時間・演出・数値(H1〜H4)は未確認。仕様の数値は暫定値として扱い、Play の確認後に調整する。
- 4(Design)の後: 仕様(Handoff 06)は計画どおりで、方向・優先度・スコープの選択は出ておらず、エスカレーションも発動しない(D-001、D-002 の範囲内。新ボタンなし)。Design(4)を `done` にし、Plan(5a)を `open` にした。
- 5a と 5b の Handoff について: 5a と 5b は独立で並列にできる(連続する seq で、route 番号に文字の接尾辞)。この Route 操作で書けるのは seq 7 の Handoff 1 つだけだったため、5a の Handoff(07)を先に作り、5b の Handoff は後続の Studio 操作が作る。5b の入力は `design/combat.md` §10 と `project.md#art-direction` で、`game-designer` の Sender assessment は渡さない。Handoff 06 が指示するとおり、Playtester に渡す Handoff には仕様の数値や §6.2 の体験の観点を書かない。
- 5a の Handoff(07)は Handoff 06 の Findings(客観的な仕様の内容)から Studio が組み立てた。`game-designer` の Sender assessment(確信度、暫定値の根拠)は技術計画に不要なので含めていない。
- 5a(Plan)の後: 技術計画(Handoff 08、D-004)は、仕様が D-001〜D-003 と制約の範囲で実現できると結論した。コードは読まず `sim/` の記述に基づく見積もりで、部屋データ、スポナー、弾の衝突、接触の判定形状は Build の最初の作業 T0 で確認する。`outcome: question` ではないため、Plan の戻りルール(仕様が実現不能)は適用しない。エスカレーションの条件(コンセプト・柱・Decision の変更、スコープ・費用・リスクの大幅な変化、不可逆な変更)にも当たらないと判断した。
- 5a の後の route 改訂: 技術側が仕様の文面と既存実装の食い違いを 3 点(怯みの扱い、接触の定義、部屋 5 の FL/FR)見つけ、仕様側の決定が要るため、Design(5c、`game-designer`)を新設して `open` にした(Handoff 09)。これは仕様の解釈であり、技術側は決められない。Build は 5b と 5c の両方の後に進める。5c は 5b と互いの出力を使わないので並列にできる。5c の答えが D-002 や D-003 の変更、スコープの変更を要する場合は、`game-designer` が `question` で返し、Decide(`game-director`)に回す。
- Handoff 09 の作り方(Route 手順 4–5): 受け手 `game-designer` の Works from(仕様の質問、Decision、設計文書)に合わせ、Handoff 08 の Findings から確認依頼 1〜3 と既定 4、判断材料の技術的事実だけを抜き出した。Handoff 08 の Sender assessment(欠陥 D の仮説を含む)は渡していない。欠陥 D の仮説は `qa` の再現に先入観を与えるため、2b の Handoff にも含めない。
- Handoff 08 は編集していない(受け手は Studio で、Load は Studio の routing のため)。
- Build が T2 と T3 を並列にする条件は、T0 で部屋のコードと敵のコントローラが別モジュールだと確認できること。Build の Handoff を作るときに、この条件と T0 で前提が崩れたときの Studio への戻しを Expected output に書く。Handoff 08 のとおり、開発用補助(部屋の選択、突進スイッチ、30/60 FPS 切り替え、状態の遷移ログ)は開発ビルド限定で、プレイヤー向けの新しい入力は足さない。
- 5c(Design)の後: 仕様の確認(Handoff 10、D-005)は D-001〜D-003 の範囲内で決まり、`outcome: done`。方向・優先度・スコープの変更も新ボタンもなく、エスカレーションの条件に当たらない。`game-director` に回す必要もない。5c を `done` にした。Handoff 10 の質問「欠陥 D の規則の追記」は 2b の結果待ちで、Build の前提ではない。
- 5c の後の次の操作: Build は 5b の後という計画を変えない。残る前提は 5b だけなので、Handoff 11 で `art-director` に 5b を始める。Handoff 11 は、受け手 `art-director` の Works from(設計仕様の視覚的含意、美術方針と制約)に合わせて Studio が組み立てた。Handoff 10 の Findings のうち視覚に関わる客観的な事実(怯まない 3 状態、接触の解決の仕方)だけを抜き出し、`game-designer` の Sender assessment と実装側への影響(Playtester・art に不要)は渡していない。`design/combat.md` §10 の本文はこの操作の入力になかったため、Handoff 11 では要約せず Load で指定した。Previous handoff を none にしたのは、Handoff 10 に Sender assessment が含まれ、5b の方針(渡さない)に反するため。
- 2b(欠陥 D の `qa`)の Handoff は今回も作っていない。理由: この操作で書けるのは seq 11 の 1 つで、5b の方が Build を止めている前提になる。2b は Build を止めず、独立している(Build の前に結果があれば、欠陥修正を Build に加える)。Owner の報告の原文が入力にないため、推測で書かない。
- Build の Handoff を作るときの条件(Route 手順 4–5 のため記録): 5b の結果(視覚要素の一覧、既存の仕組みで足りるかの見立て)と `design/combat.md`、D-004、D-005 を渡す。Handoff 10 の「実装側への影響」(解決済みフラグ、除外状態、遠い方の選択はデータの規則)は技術情報として `gameplay-engineer` に渡してよいが、Sender assessment は渡さない。
- 5b(Design)の後: 視覚仕様(Handoff 12、D-006)は `outcome: done`。`art-director` は戦闘の規則・数値の変更は不要と判断しており、`question` ではない。D-001〜D-005 の範囲内で、新ボタンも方向・スコープの変更もなく、エスカレーションの条件に当たらない。5b を `done` にし、計画どおり Build(6)を `open` にした(Handoff 13)。
- Handoff 13 の作り方(Route 手順 4–5): 受け手 `gameplay-engineer` の Works from(承認済みの仕様、計画、制約、リポジトリ)に合わせ、Handoff 12 の Findings から視覚要素と見立て・未確認の点を客観的な事実として抜き出した。Handoff 12 と同様、Sender assessment(確信度、費用の見立ての根拠)は渡していない。Handoff 08 も Previous handoff にせず(Sender assessment に欠陥 D の仮説があるため)、計画の内容は D-004 を Load で渡す。Handoff 12 は編集していない(`to: studio` で、Load は Studio の routing のため)。Expected output に、Verify で `qa` と `art-director` を並列にするための `to: studio` と、T0 の結果で前提が崩れたときの戻し先(仕様の欠落は Design、計画の不成立は Plan、視覚要素の実現不能は `art-director` への仕様調整を Studio 経由で)を書いた。
- 未処理(Build を止めない): Handoff 12 の Open question により、`design/combat.md` §10 に `design/grub-charge-telegraph.md` への参照を追記する必要がある。書き込めるのは `game-designer` のため、後続の Studio 操作で小さな Handoff(次の空き seq)として回す。Build は視覚仕様を Load で直接読むので、これを待たない。ただし Verify の前に済ませる。
- Playtester に渡す Handoff には、視覚仕様 §10.2 の体験の観点を書かない(Handoff 12 の指示、および Playtester の Independence)。

## Next action

Studio は Route を終えて停止する。次の操作は、互いに独立な以下の 3 つ。
1. 人間が Handoff `goals/G-001-combat-monotony/13-studio-to-gameplay-engineer.md` から `gameplay-engineer`(Build、`implement-change`)のステップを開始する。T0 の調査から始める。成果は変更と、`to: studio` 宛ての Handoff。
2. Studio が 2b(`qa`、`reproduce-defect`)の Handoff `NN-studio-to-qa.md`(次の空き seq、14 以降)を作る Route 操作を行う。Owner の報告の原文と設計文書のみを渡し、プレイテスターや技術側の推測は含めない。Build と並行してよい。
3. Studio が `game-designer` 宛ての小さな Handoff(次の空き seq)で、`design/combat.md` §10 に視覚仕様への参照を追記させる。Verify の前までに済ませる。

その後の予定: Build が終わったら、Studio が Route を行い、Verify(`qa` の `verify-change` と `art-director` の `visual-review` の並列。実装側の Sender assessment は `qa` に渡さない)に進む。

Owner への報告(日本語):
- 突進の予告の見た目が決まった(D-006)。地面に突進の通り道(レーン)を示し、敵の背中が熾火のように光り、体が沈み込む。色だけに頼らず、形と動きでも読める。戦闘の規則や数値は変わらず、新ボタンも要らない。Owner の判断は要らない。
- 次に `gameplay-engineer` が実装する。最初に既存の仕組みを調べ、前提が崩れたら実装に入らず戻す。並行して、被弾直後のダッシュ中のダメージの疑いを `qa` が再現する。その後に QA、視覚の確認、プレイテスト、Review へ進む。
- ゲームパッドの操作感、0.7 秒の予告で足りるか、暗い床での読み取りやすさは、未確認のドライラン上の判断で、実機の確認後に調整する。

# 14: gameplay-engineer → studio — T0 を完了できず、実装に入らず返す(コードを読めない・書けない)

## Task

T0(既存の仕組みの調査)の結果を受けて、実装を続けられる条件(リポジトリへのアクセス、または T0 の報告)を整えるか、Plan に回すかを決めてほしい。実装は一切行っていない。`qa` と `art-director` に渡すものは、まだ無い。

## Context

Handoff 13 は、予告つき Grub 突進、部屋の波と進行、予告の見た目の実装を求めている。最初に T0 を行い、前提が崩れたら実装に入らず返す、という指示だった。

この工程のパケットには、ゲームのコードもビルドも入っていない。使えたのは仕様、Decision、`sim/repo-notes.md`、`sim/build-0.3.md` だけである。書き込めるのは、この Handoff 1 つだけである。コードの変更、テストの実行、動かせるビルドの用意はできない。D-004 が「`sim/` の記述に基づく見積もりで、コードは読んでいない」と書いているのと同じ状況が続いている。

## Findings

### 実施した範囲

- 仕様(`design/combat.md`、`design/grub-charge-telegraph.md`)と D-001〜D-006 を読み、`sim/repo-notes.md` と照らして、T0 の確認項目に答えられるか調べた。
- 実装、テスト、ビルドは行っていない。

### T0 の確認項目ごとの結果

`sim/repo-notes.md` に書かれていたこと(確認できた事実):

- 敵は 1 つの共通コントローラを共有する。状態は Idle、Chase、Attack。種別ごとの違いはデータ(速度、HP、攻撃の種類)と小さな種別ごとの攻撃ルーチンである。D-004 の「状態の追加」の前提と矛盾しない。
- 被弾した敵は、0.2 s の Flinch に入る。Attack を含め、実行中の行動を中断し、Chase に戻る。D-005 の怯みの規則(突進型の Windup、Charge、Recovery では怯まない)は、状態で分岐する必要がある。
- プレイヤーの攻撃は、前方の短い弧の判定で、敵との重なりでダメージを与える。
- プレイヤーの無敵は、オン/オフの 1 つのフラグである。ダッシュは 0.25 s のタイマーを、被弾は被弾から 0.8 s 後に終わるタイマーを開始する。どちらのタイマーも、終わるとフラグをオフにする。
  - 2 つのタイマーが 1 つのフラグを共有している。被弾直後にダッシュすると、先に終わったタイマーが、もう一方の無敵をオフにしうる構造である。欠陥 D の原因候補だが、確定ではない。
  - 欠陥 D は今回の範囲外。D-004 の無敵の問い合わせ関数は、この 1 つのフラグを読む形で作れる。
- 移動は単純なステアリングで、壁で止まる。
- 更新は可変 delta で、30/60 FPS をサポートしている。D-004 の delta 上限 0.05 s を入れる余地はある。
- 敵とプレイヤーのテストは無い。無敵のテストも無い。テストの枠組みの有無は不明。

`sim/repo-notes.md` に書かれておらず、確認できなかったこと:

- 部屋データの形、スポナー、「3〜6 体を最初に全部出す」前提かどうか(波に対応できるか)。D-004 の見積もりが成り立つかは未確認。
- 部屋のコードと敵のコントローラが別モジュールか。T2 と T3 を並列にしてよいかは判断できない。
- 敵とプレイヤーの接触の判定形状(円か、矩形か)。スイープ判定の方法と、レーン幅を「接触判定の範囲」に合わせる元の値が決まらない。
- Spitter の弾が、壁で消え、敵を通り抜ける扱いか。弾の衝突の仕組み。
- 視覚の仕組みについて、以下のすべて。
  - 地面層に半透明の帯を描けるか。
  - スプライトの色変調と変形(拡大縮小、描画ずらし)ができるか。
  - 重ね絵ができるか。
  - 敵の HP 表示と被弾の白いフラッシュがあるか。
  - 既存の出現演出、粒子があるか。
  - Spitter の弾の色、ランタンの色(レーンの赤橙との差)。
  - 接触の結果(無敵で抜けた/被弾)を見た目へ出す口を作れるか(要素 9)。
- 仕様の §9 の項目 6(敵の挙動を経過時間で進めているか)は、可変 delta という記述から時間ベースらしいと分かる程度で、確認できていない。

### 判断した点

- 確認できないまま、コードを前提にして実装すると、D-004 の見積もりの外れを見落とす危険がある。T0 を飛ばさない、という指示に従い、実装には入らなかった。
- 仕様そのものの曖昧さ・矛盾は、今回の範囲では見つけていない。`game-designer` への質問は無い。
- 要素 9 の判断(Open questions の 1 つ目)は、判断材料(見た目への口の実態)が無いため、まだできない。省くとも省かないとも決めていない。

## Decisions already made

- D-001〜D-006 は変更しない。どれも、この返しの理由ではない。

## Constraints

- 戦闘の規則、数値、仕様、D-004 の計画は変えていない。
- 欠陥 D の修正は含めない(Handoff 13 のとおり)。

## Open questions

1. 次のどちらで進めるか。Studio が決めてほしい。
   - (a) リポジトリ(コード、ビルド、テスト実行の手段)を使える形で、Build をやり直す。実装は T0 から始める。
   - (b) 別の担当に T0 だけを行わせ、報告(上の「確認できなかったこと」の各項目)を Handoff にして、改めて Build に渡す。技術側の見積もりが外れていた場合は、`technical-director` が Plan を見直す。
2. 要素 9(接触の結果の通知)が D-004 の「見た目への口」に含まれるか。T0 の結果が出るまで判断できない。含まれず、追加も難しい場合は、判断が技術方針に関わるため、Studio 経由で `technical-director` に回してほしい。
3. 必須の視覚要素(Handoff 13 の 1〜6)が既存の仕組みで実現できるか。T0 が済むまで不明。縮小案(仕様 §11)で足りるかは、そのとき確認する。

## Expected output

次の工程への情報。

- 実装済みの変更は無い。`qa` と `art-director` の Verify は、まだ始められない。Studio は Verify の Handoff を組まないでほしい。
- 進められること: 上の Open questions 1 の回答を受けて、T0 から再開する。T0 の後、問題が無ければ、T1(状態とスイープ判定)、T2(部屋と波)、T3(突進の振る舞い)、見た目の作業に進む。並列化は T0 の結果次第。
- ブロックされていること: すべての実装、テスト、ビルドの説明。

## Sender assessment

- 推測で実装コードを書いて渡すことも考えたが、コードベースを見ていないので、命名、構造、テストの置き場が合わない可能性が高い。D-004 の見積もりの外れが、後で大きな手戻りになりうる。そのため、止めて返すのが妥当と判断した。
- `sim/repo-notes.md` のうち、無敵が 1 つのフラグを 2 つのタイマーで共有していることは、D-004 の「問い合わせ関数」の設計に関わる。欠陥 D の再現が出たら、`technical-director` が、問い合わせ関数の前提(1 つの真偽で答える)を見直す必要があるかもしれない。今回は触らない。
- 確信度: 「T0 を完了できない」という結論の確信度は高い。実装の難しさについての見立ては、根拠が無いので出さない。
