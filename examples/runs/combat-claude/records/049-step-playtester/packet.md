## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 41: studio → playtester — ビルド 0.6 を遊んで、戦闘の体験を報告する

## Task

ビルド 0.6 を、下のプレイヤー像のプレイヤーとして遊び、体験したことをそのまま報告する。今回は特に戦闘に注意を向ける。

## Context

ランタンの光る洞窟を 1 部屋ずつ下りる、短時間のトップダウン・アクション・ローグライトの試作版を遊んでもらう。このプロジェクトでは「ビルドを動かす」とは、プレイヤーに見える記述 `sim/build-0.6.md` を読み、その場面を遊んだつもりで体験を報告することを指す(ドライランの約束事)。

## Findings

(この Handoff は Studio が組んだ。Playtester に渡す実装・変更に関する情報はない。)

プレイヤー像(`project.md#player-profile`):
短時間で濃いランを求めるアクション好き。回避と間合いには慣れているが、コンボ表を覚えるのは好まない。主にゲームパッドで遊ぶ。

## Decisions already made

None

## Constraints

- 入力はビルド記述にある操作だけで遊ぶ。
- 見えたこと、感じたこと、起きたことだけを書く。原因の推測や設計の提案は、観察と分けて書く。
- 記述を読むだけでは判断できなかったこと(実時間の感触、画面の実際の見え方、ゲームパッドの操作感など)は、「確認できなかった」と明記する。推測で埋めない。

## Open questions

None

## Expected output

観察報告(`playtest-session` の形式)を `goals/G-001-combat-monotony/42-playtester-to-studio.md` に書く(`to: studio`)。次の Review の Handoff を Studio が組むためで、判定や解決策の決定は求めない。不具合らしい挙動を見つけたら、観察としてそのまま書く。

# Role: Playtester

## Responsibility

Evaluates the game as a player: what is fun, boring, confusing or frustrating, based only on what a
player can observe.

## Decides

Nothing about the game. Owns the honesty and accuracy of its observations.

## Must not

- Read source code, diffs, implementation notes, or design intent before playing.
- Propose code-level fixes or judge against the design document instead of the experience.
- Report observations it did not actually make.

## Independence

Works from the build and a player profile only, in a fresh executor context without implementation
history. Is not told what changed or what result is expected, so that it cannot confirm a
hypothesis it was handed.

## Works from

A Handoff composed by the Studio (never one written by a Role that knows the implementation):

- How to obtain and run the build, and which part to play.
- The player profile from the Project Context.
- Optionally a play focus that does not reveal the expected result (e.g., "pay attention to
  combat", not "check whether combat is less monotonous now").

## Produces

- An observation report: concrete moments, what the player did and felt, friction, quotes in
  player language, how strongly each issue affected the experience, and the method used to play.

## Hands back / escalates when

Sets `to` per the route; the Studio's Route operation confirms or changes it. Experience issues go
to `game-designer`, defects to `qa`.

# Skill: Playtest session

Typical roles: playtester.

## When to use

To observe how the game plays or feels, before diagnosis or after a change.

## Inputs

How to obtain and run the build, what to play, the player profile, optionally a neutral play focus.

## Method

1. Adopt the player profile. Play as that player would, not as a tester hunting edge cases.
2. Log concrete moments: what you tried, what happened, what you felt, and when your attention
   dropped or spiked.
3. Note friction, confusion, boredom and delight in player language ("I never needed to dodge").
4. Rate how much each issue affected the experience. Separate observations from hypotheses.
5. State the method you actually used to play (live play, input automation, recorded sessions,
   human playtest notes). If you could not observe something, say so.

## Output

Observation report: method, session summary, concrete moments, issues with impact, positives,
open player questions.

## Do not

Read source code or design intent first. Invent observations. Prescribe code-level fixes.
>>>END

<<<FILE project.md#player-profile
## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

# Simulated build 0.6 — what playing it looks like

A player-observable description only. Lengths are in seconds, distances in tiles, speeds in tiles per second. Everything below holds the same at 30 FPS and 60 FPS unless a difference is stated.

## Rooms and waves

- Every room sends its enemies in two waves. The first wave appears when the room starts. The second wave appears when the number of living enemies drops to the room's threshold, or when the room's timer runs out, whichever happens first.
- Enemies that are fading in count as living. Enemies still waiting to appear do not count.
- The timer starts when the last enemy of the earlier wave has finished fading in. If that enemy had to wait at its spot first, the timer starts after the wait and the fade-in.
- Each room has six spots where enemies appear: the door side, the far side (back middle), the left side, the right side, the far-left corner and the far-right corner. There is no spot in a near corner by the door. The only corners enemies appear in are the two far corners.
- Room 1: wave 1 is two ordinary Grubs, left and right. Wave 2 is one ordinary Grub at the far side. It comes when one or fewer enemies are alive, or 10 s after the last wave-1 Grub finished fading in. 3 enemies in total, at most 2 at once. No charging Grubs.
- Room 2: wave 1 is one charging Grub at the far side. Wave 2 is two ordinary Grubs (left, right) and one more charging Grub (far side). It comes when no enemy is alive, or 15 s after the wave-1 Grub finished fading in. 4 enemies in total, at most 3 at once.
- Room 3: wave 1 is a Spitter at the far side and an ordinary Grub on the left. Wave 2 is a Spitter in whichever far corner (far-left or far-right) is farther from you at the moment the wave is triggered, and an ordinary Grub on the right. It comes when one or fewer are alive, or 12 s after the last wave-1 enemy finished fading in. 4 enemies in total, at most 3 at once. Spitters fire every 2.0 s. No charging Grubs.
- Room 4: wave 1 is a Spitter in the far-left corner, a charging Grub at the far side and an ordinary Grub on the left. Wave 2 is a Spitter in the far-right corner and a charging Grub on the right. It comes when one or fewer are alive, or 12 s after the last wave-1 enemy finished fading in. 5 enemies in total, at most 3 at once. Spitters fire every 1.8 s.
- Room 5: wave 1 is a Spitter at the far side and two ordinary Grubs, left and right. Wave 2 is a Spitter in the farther of the far-left and far-right corners (chosen as in room 3) and two charging Grubs, left and right. It comes when one or fewer are alive, or 12 s after the last wave-1 enemy finished fading in. 6 enemies in total, at most 4 at once. Spitters fire every 1.6 s.
- A room ends when every wave has appeared and every enemy is dead.
- The farther-corner choice (rooms 3 and 5, wave 2) is made when the wave is triggered, before any waiting, using where you stand at that moment. The far-left corner and the far-right corner are compared by distance from the center of you to the center of each spot, and the one with the greater distance gets the Spitter. If the two distances are exactly equal, the far-left corner is used. It is never a near corner, because there is none. If you move while the wave waits, the choice does not change. A corner that a room names for a specific enemy is not part of this choice.

### How fast Grubs walk

Ordinary and charging Grubs in the same room walk at the same speed:
- Room 1: 2.0
- Room 2: 2.0
- Room 3: 2.2
- Room 4: 2.2
- Room 5: 2.4

This is walking speed only. A charge always runs at 8.0. Spitters stand still.

### Standing near a spawn point

- If you are closer than 4 tiles (center to center) to the spot where an enemy would appear, that enemy does not appear yet. It appears as soon as you are 4 tiles or farther away, or after 2.0 s of waiting, whichever comes first.
- Each spot of a wave waits on its own. All spots of one wave start waiting at the same moment, when the wave is triggered. A spot that has finished waiting does not wait again if you walk back to it. You are not pushed away from a spot, and the enemy can appear on top of you.
- While some enemies of a wave are still waiting, the next wave's threshold and timer are not running. They start only once every enemy in the wave has begun fading in.
  - If one or fewer enemies are alive at that moment, the next wave comes immediately. Otherwise it comes when the count drops to the threshold, or when the timer runs out.
  - Room 1: stand near the left spot only. The right Grub appears and the second wave does not come while the left spot waits. If you kill the right Grub during the wait, then when the left Grub begins fading in only one enemy is alive, and the wave-2 Grub comes at once. If you did not kill it, the second wave comes after one is killed, or 10 s after the later one finished fading in.
  - Room 2: if the charging Grub's spot is waiting, the second wave cannot come until it begins fading in. After that it comes when the Grub is dead, or 15 s after it finished fading in. The Grub cannot be hurt during its first 0.8 s of fading in, so the earliest kill is after that.
  - Waves with no waiting spots start counting the moment they appear.

## Enemies appearing

- Every enemy fades in for 0.8 s: from 40% to full opacity, with a pale blue ring at its feet. During this time it does not move, does not attack, does not hurt you, and your swipes do nothing to it (no damage, no flinch).
- A Spitter fires its first shot 1.0 s after it finishes fading in, then at the room's interval. A Spitter shot travels at 4.0, straight at where you stood when it fired, costs 1 heart, vanishes on walls, and passes through enemies without hurting them. Spitters flinch for 0.2 s when hit, as before.

## Charging Grubs

Charging Grubs (rooms 2, 4, 5) look like ordinary Grubs with a dark ember-colored ridge on the back, visible from the moment they fade in. Ordinary Grubs have no ridge. They have 2 HP, and walk and bite like ordinary Grubs. While walking they flinch for 0.2 s when hit.

A charging Grub starts a charge only when all of the following hold:
- at least 1.5 s have passed since it finished fading in;
- at least 2.5 s have passed since its last recovery ended, that is, since it went back to walking after its last charge. The 0.8 s of recovery is not part of the 2.5 s. For example, if a charge ends at time t, the Grub stands in recovery until t+0.8, and its next wind-up can begin no earlier than t+3.3. A Grub that has never charged has no such wait;
- you are 3.0 to 6.0 tiles away (center to center);
- no other living charging Grub is currently winding up or charging.

Flinching does not reset these waits. If two charging Grubs qualify in the same moment (room 5, wave 2, left and right), one of them goes first, in a fixed but not obvious order. The other waits until the first has finished charging.

The sequence:
1. **Wind-up, 0.7 s.** The Grub stops where it stands and its walking animation stops. A red-orange lane appears on the floor from the Grub toward where you were when the wind-up began. The lane is as long as the charge will be, 7 tiles or less if a wall is in the way, and as wide as the Grub's body (within 0.1 tile). It has a bright edge, a dark underline and a chevron every tile pointing along the lane. It stays lit regardless of floor darkness. Spitter shots, fading-in enemies and other enemies are drawn on top of it. The lane fades from 35% to full brightness over the wind-up. The Grub squashes to 80% height, widens a little and leans back from the lane. The ridge and eyes warm from dark to red-orange, turning pale-yellow in the final 0.1 s. The direction is fixed; moving afterwards does not turn the lane. The Grub does no damage during the wind-up.
2. **Charge.** The Grub rushes along the lane at 8.0 for up to 7 tiles (about 0.875 s), or until it hits a wall, and stretches long and thin with a bright core and red-orange edge. The lane flashes extra bright once at the start, stays at full brightness, and disappears behind the Grub as it passes. The part in front stays until the charge ends, then everything fades out over 0.1 s. Afterimages appear every half tile and fade over 0.2 s, with dust at its feet. It passes through other enemies without hurting them. Hitting a wall has no special effect; the Grub simply stops and goes into recovery.
3. **Recovery, 0.8 s.** The Grub stands still, sunk to 90% height and tinted a dull grey-blue, fully opaque, with thin steam rising from its feet every 0.3 s. Ridge and eyes go dark within 0.1 s. It returns to normal in the last 0.2 s and goes back to walking toward you. It cannot start another wind-up for 2.5 s after this moment.

### Getting hit by a charge

- A charge can hurt you at most once. The first time the Grub's body overlaps you during a charge decides it. If it was already overlapping you as the charge began, that counts as the first moment.
  - If you are invulnerable at that moment (for example, mid-dash), you take nothing. A thin pale white-blue ring appears around you for 0.15 s, and the Grub keeps running through you. The Grub's core dims to a darker red-orange for the rest of the charge. Staying inside it afterward, or the dash ending while it still overlaps you, does not hurt you.
  - If you are not invulnerable, you lose 1 heart, with the normal hit reaction and the normal invulnerability afterward. The core dims in the same way. No ring appears.
- Overlap during the wind-up or recovery does nothing. A new charge starts the count again.
- The invulnerability check uses the state you are in at that frame. At 30 FPS the end of the dash's 0.25 s protection can differ from 60 FPS by up to one frame (about 0.034 s).

### Hitting a charging Grub

- During the wind-up, charge and recovery, your swipes lower its HP only. It does not flinch, is not pushed back, and does not change direction, speed or timing. It flashes white for 0.1 s with small sparks at the point of impact. The lane and ridge do not change.
- With 1 HP left, a small crack mark appears on its body.
- At 0 HP it dies immediately in any state. A dying winder or charger removes its lane within 0.1 s, and another charging Grub may then start its own wind-up.
- Charging Grubs that are walking, ordinary Grubs and Spitters flinch 0.2 s as before.

## Your own numbers

Nothing about you has changed:
- Your swipe does 1 damage and takes 0.35 s to recover.
- Your dash covers 4 tiles in 0.25 s, you are invulnerable for all of it, and it has a 0.6 s cooldown. A swipe pressed during a dash comes out when the dash ends.
- A hit costs 1 heart, locks your input for 0.3 s, and you are invulnerable until 0.8 s after the hit.
- Movement speed, swipe reach and your size are unchanged. No new buttons.

## Timing at 30 and 60 FPS

- Fade-in, wind-up, charge distance, recovery, the 2.5 s wait, wave timers and spawn waiting are all counted in real time. Durations at 30 FPS are within about 0.034 s of those at 60 FPS.
- Whether a charge touches you does not depend on the frame rate.
- The farther-corner choice gives the same result at 30 and 60 FPS for the same positions.
- Pausing freezes all timers and animations, including lanes, steam and rings. Resuming after a long pause does not skip ahead more than a short step (0.05 s).
- Nothing flashes more than three times per second, apart from single flashes.

## What play feels like now

- Rooms 1 and 3 behave like before but with two waves, so there is a second arrival to deal with.
- In rooms 2, 4 and 5, standing still in a corner and swiping no longer works: a lane appears, and about 0.7 s later a Grub runs the length of it. Moving off the lane or dashing through the Grub avoids damage. Swiping the Grub during the run only chips it and does not stop it.
- A single charging Grub charges again about 3.3 s or more after its previous charge ended, and later if you are out of the 3.0–6.0 range or another one is busy.
- Only one charging Grub is ever winding up or charging at a time.
- In rooms 3 and 5, the second-wave Spitter appears in the far corner that is farther from you when the wave is triggered; if you stand exactly equally far from both, it appears in the far-left corner.
- No new sounds. No new buttons.
- As before, occasionally, if you dash right after being hit, you take damage partway through the dash. This also applies to a charge that reaches you at that moment.

## Development build only

- A tester can pick room 1–5, switch charging Grubs on or off per room (off turns every charging Grub into an ordinary Grub, with no ridge, no lane and no charge; the room's counts, waves and spots stay the same), and switch between 30 and 60 FPS.
- A log lists state changes with game time, enemy and type, charge direction, contact result (unresolved, slipped through, hit), wave arrivals with spots, the distance to you when a wind-up began, and the moment all enemies of a wave have begun fading in. For the farther-corner choice, the log shows which corner was chosen: far-left or far-right.
- The log also records the time each charging Grub's recovery ended and it went back to walking, so the gap to its next wind-up can be read directly.
