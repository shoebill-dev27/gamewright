# D-004: Rooms 4–5 get a rule-based 0.6 s cue gap; the brute's wind-up is not cancelled by a swipe; the room 2 spitter is deferred

## Decision

1. **Cue gap as a rule (rooms 4 and 5 only).** A spitter may start a cue only when no other spitter's cue is running and the last shot in the room was at least 0.6 s ago (plus the existing cap). The first-shot offset in these rooms is 1.2 s (shots at 1.8 s and 3.0 s, then alternating every 1.2 s), which meets the rule exactly. The interval stays 2.4 s, the cap stays 3, and room 3 is unchanged.
2. **Brute is not cancelled by a swipe in wind-up.** A per-variant flag "swipe cancels wind-up": standard yes, runner yes, brute no. A swipe still damages the brute, shows "the brute shrugs off the swipe", and the lunge goes ahead. The lane geometry is the same for all variants.
3. **Option 3 (a spitter in room 2) is deferred** out of this slice.

## Rationale

- The crossfire problem (31, S4) is that a cue locks 0.2 s after the previous one ends, at the place the player dodged to. The playtest said the spitters fired "in sync", which the room table and the spec do not support. A rule on cue windows is correct either way, and a fixed offset alone would not be: a cap delay can push two cues together and the offset would not stop it. The offset is chosen so that the rule normally never has to delay anything, which keeps the verified first-shot timing style.
- The melee enemies share one answer (31, S1). A per-variant flag reuses the existing wind-up rule, keeps lane geometry and cue visuals identical (visual spec), needs no new input (D-001) and no new enemy. The brute is the best carrier: it is slow, has the longest warning and the longest recovery, so "step aside, then punish" is readable and fair.
- Option 3 would change criterion 14 and the room 2 identity at the same moment as the brute rule. Both aim at the brute dodging for 20 s, and it is not known whether the brute rule is enough. Doing both together would also make the next playtest unable to say which change worked.

## Alternatives considered

- **Only change the offset, no rule:** simpler, but not robust against a cap delay or against the unconfirmed "in sync" claim. Not chosen.
- **Lower the shot cap to 2 in rooms 4–5:** shortens the number of lines in the air, but delays cues unpredictably and makes the cue timing differ from room 3 in a way the player cannot read. Not chosen; the longer spacing already reduces shots in the air through the existing cap.
- **Gap rule in room 3 too:** room 3 teaches the cue and is verified; criterion 11 would change for no reported problem. Not chosen.
- **A new melee enemy, or widening a lane for the brute so that a dash is needed:** needs a Decide step or breaks the "identical lane geometry" rule of the visual spec. Not chosen.
- **Brute swipe cancels only with the second swipe, or cancels with a longer stagger:** a more complex rule for the player to learn, with no extra answer. Not chosen.
- **Take Option 3 in this slice:** deferred (see Rationale).

## Revisit when

- The hand-timed playtest after Build shows the crossfire in rooms 4–5 is still unfair, or the gap makes it trivial (then the gap and offset are tuning values).
- The playtest shows a human still dodges the brute without ever fighting it in room 2 (then take Option 3 or a room change in a new spec step).
- The bots show the 13/14/15 expectations cannot be met on 0.6 and the cause is the design, not bot policy.
- A graphical build changes cue presentation in a way that makes the "no flinch" signal unreadable.
