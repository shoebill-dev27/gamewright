# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.6

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears, with the room drawn every half second and after every hit or warning.

## Continuous run and diagnostic rooms

Run a script with `python3 play.py --view player SCRIPT`; use `--view trace` for developer
state. Start a normal run with:

```text
mode run
fps 60
limit 1200
driver-limit 1205
0 move left
0.5 stop
0.5 attack
```

A normal run starts in room 1 with 3 hearts and advances through rooms 1–5. Defeat every enemy
to advance. Rooms 1–4 show a clear screen for 1 second, then restore 1 heart up to 3 on entry.
Position, movement, combat timers and queued attacks reset on entry. Room 5 contains one boss.
Death ends the run; defeating the boss while alive wins.

`mode room` selects an independent diagnostic room. Add `room 5` to inspect the boss. This
is a fresh diagnostic session, not a checkpoint. Normal runs reject `room`, `spawn` and `player`
setup.

| Public directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `limit 1200` | Per-attempt simulation time limit; reports unfinished separately from combat outcome. |
| `driver-limit 1205` | Driver duration including pauses and terminal screens. |
| `control 2 pause` | Pause at driver time 2; held movement stops. |
| `control 4 resume` | Resume at driver time 4, while simulation clocks are frozen. |
| `control 20 retry` | After normal-run victory or death, restart at room 1 with 3 hearts. |
| `attempt 2` | Following timed combat inputs belong to the second attempt. |
| `trace-every frame` | Emit developer state every driver tick. |

Controls use driver time. Combat inputs use run time in normal runs and room time in diagnostics.
Equal-time inputs run in source order, after controls and before reaction rules. Combat inputs
due during pause or a clear screen are discarded. Retry discards pending inputs from the old
attempt. Reaction definitions persist; cooldown and previous-view memory reset on entry.

Driver seconds are simulated elapsed time, including pause and terminal waiting.
`processing_seconds` measures headless processing time; it is not human play time.

Scripts with none of the new directives retain the legacy independent-room route described
below, including its 60-second maximum and default duration. Add `mode room` explicitly to use
the public driver and its longer limit. Legacy room 5 does not yet provide the complete boss
messages and status display; use explicit `mode room` for boss observation.

## Boss and public display

`B` is the boss, with 12 HP. Swipes deal 1 damage in every phase. A nonlethal swipe does not
interrupt its warning. It alternates charge and short shot, approaching before each attack.

- Charge: a fixed-direction 0.7-second warning, then 2.4 tiles of movement over 0.3 seconds.
  Contact radius is 0.6 tile. Recovery lasts 1.2 seconds.
- Short shot: a fixed-direction 0.8-second warning, then one projectile at 3 tiles/second,
  with a 1-second lifetime and contact radius 0.4 tile. Recovery starts 1 second after firing
  and lasts 1.4 seconds, even if the shot hits or is absorbed earlier.
- Move sideways off the locked line or dash through contact. Recovery is harmless and permits
  approaching and swiping. Warnings cannot be stopped by repeated nonlethal swipes.

The public player view displays room, hearts, both simulation clocks, boss HP, phase and next
attack. Warning text gives the locked direction, time remaining and danger dimensions.
`~` cells approximate the fixed path; they are not the exact continuous collision boundary.
Charge path length is 2.4 tiles with rounded ends of radius 0.6; short-shot range is 3 tiles
with contact radius 0.4. The active-shot count includes projectiles hidden beneath another mark.

Victory and death messages name retry and its return to room 1. In diagnostic mode retry is
rejected. These commands describe the text/script build; keyboard and gamepad operation has
not been verified.

Integration verification remains incomplete: no saved-version execution results accompany this
manual update. See `public-driver.md` for remaining observation and tooling gaps.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face). You cannot be hurt while dashing.

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|runner\|brute\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |
| `when <condition> then <action>` | A reaction rule (below). |

## Reactions

Instead of (or as well as) timed inputs, you can play by reacting to what is on screen. Each frame
the rules are checked from the top; the first one whose condition holds acts. A rule acts at most
every 0.15 s, like a player's reaction time, so the next rule down can act meanwhile. A session
with rules runs until the room is cleared or you go down (at most 60 s), unless `end` says
otherwise.

| Condition | Holds when |
|---|---|
| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `r`, `G`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown (for example `text "rears back"`) |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see r within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `r` runner grub, `G` brute grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile, `~` an orange-red
line (see warnings below). Hearts are shown above the room.

- **Grub (`g`)**: 2 swipes. **Runner (`r`)**: fast, 1 swipe, short warning. **Brute (`G`)**: slow,
  4 swipes, long warning, and it does not flinch: a swipe does not interrupt its warning.
- **Spitter (`s`)**: 2 swipes, stays where it is.

## Warnings

Nothing hurts you without a warning. Every warning is shown for the whole time before the hit, and
the player view prints a picture when one starts.

- **A grub rears back** (message `a grub rears back`, `a runner rears back` or `a brute rears back`): the grub stops and flashes orange-red, and a
  line of `~` marks the 2.4 tiles it is about to lunge along. Under the room a line starting with
  `cue:` names the grub, says it flashes, and gives the line's direction and the seconds left. The
  line is fixed where you stood when the grub began; step 1 tile to the side or dash to avoid the
  lunge, or swipe a grub or runner to cancel it. A swipe cancels only during the warning, and only if the enemy is within 1.5 tiles at that moment. A grub starts rearing back about 2 tiles away, beyond your reach, so step in to within 1.5 tiles during the warning. A swipe that lands after the lunge has begun does not cancel it. When it happens the game says so: `the grub's lunge had already started, the swipe was too late to stop it` (or runner, or brute). One swipe is enough to cancel a grub or a runner. A brute is never cancelled. The warning lasts 0.5 s for a
  grub, 0.35 s for a runner, 0.7 s for a brute. After a lunge the grub is harmless for a while:
  that is the time to swipe it. Only one grub rears back or lunges at a time.
- **The brute does not flinch** (message `the brute shrugs off the swipe`): a swipe that hits a
  brute while it rears back still hurts it, but the warning goes on and the lunge still comes.
  Step aside or dash, then swipe it once it has lunged.
- **A spitter takes aim** (message `a spitter takes aim`): 0.6 s before it spits, the spitter glows
  orange-red, growing brighter, and a line of `~` shows where the shot will go. The `cue:` line
  under the room gives its brightness and the seconds left. The shot goes along that line
  (`a spitter spits`). Moving 1 tile aside or dashing avoids it. Shots are slow-looking but travel
  3 tiles a second. A spitter will not start aiming while 3 shots are already in the air, but shots from aims already under way still fire, so in room 3 up to 5 can be in the air at once. In room 4 the two spitters
  take aim one at a time: a spitter does not start aiming until the other has spat and 0.6 s have
  passed, so there is time to move between aims.
- Being hit shows `YOU ARE HIT by a grub`, `by a runner`, `by a brute` or `by a shot from the <direction>` (north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west, west or north-west: the side the shot came from, the same line the `cue:` line and `~` showed before the shot).
- A swipe that interrupts the warning of a grub or runner staggers it for 0.4 s; a brute is not
  interrupted.
- A shot that reaches you while you are dashing or still flashing after a hit is stopped and does
  no damage.
- A grub's lunge that touches you while you cannot be hurt does no damage, even if your protection
  ends during that lunge.
