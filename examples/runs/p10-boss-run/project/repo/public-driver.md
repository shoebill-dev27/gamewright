# Public Session driver — build 0.6-g002-public-32

This integration is untested. The legacy script route remains available.

Run `python3 play.py --view player SCRIPT` or replace `player` with `trace`.
A script containing any new directive below selects the Session driver.

| Directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode run` | Normal run from room 1; room, spawn and player setup are rejected. |
| `mode room` | Independent diagnostic room; default for the new driver. |
| `room 5` | Diagnostic room selection, not a checkpoint. |
| `fps 30` / `fps 60` | Fixed simulation rate. |
| `attempt 2` | Subsequent timed combat inputs belong to attempt 2. |
| `control 2 pause` | Pause at driver time 2 seconds. |
| `control 4 resume` | Resume at driver time 4 seconds, even while game time is frozen. |
| `control 20 retry` | Retry at driver time 20; accepted only at a normal-run terminal. |
| `limit 1200` | Per-attempt game-time limit; distinct from combat result. |
| `driver-limit 1205` | Driver duration, including pause and terminal screens. |
| `trace-every frame` | Emit trace state every driver tick. |

Timed combat inputs and existing reaction rules retain their syntax. Timed inputs use run time
in run mode and room time in diagnostic mode. Equal-time inputs retain source order.
Controls run first. Inputs due during pause or room-clear display are consumed and rejected.
Retry discards previous attempts' pending inputs. Rule cooldown and previous-view memory reset
on entry. Driver time is simulated elapsed time, not wall-clock elapsed time.

Example:

```text
mode run
fps 60
limit 10
driver-limit 13
0 dash right
control 0.1 pause
0.1 attack
control 2.1 resume
```

For a diagnostic boss display:

```text
mode room
room 5
fps 30
limit 8
trace-every frame
```

The public player view displays both game clocks, room, hearts, boss phase and next attack,
warning direction and dimensions, recovery time, and active shot count. The `~` cells approximate
the fixed path: they are not the exact continuous collision boundary. Charge path length is
2.4 tiles with contact radius 0.6; short-shot range is 3.0 tiles with contact radius 0.4.

The public syntax and boss instructions are now included in manual.md and linked from README.md.
The legacy route remains separate and lacks complete boss presentation.

Known incomplete work: shot IDs and complete removal reasons, boss-aware bots, complete
acceptance coverage, normal-run measurements, and unifying boss observation across script routes.
No real keyboard or gamepad verification is claimed.
