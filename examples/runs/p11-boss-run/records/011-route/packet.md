# Studio operation packet

operation: Route
goal: G-002
step_artifacts: goals/G-002-final-boss/08-game-director-to-studio.md
next_seq: 9
context_request: allowed once (@need, up to 8 paths)
current_build: repo/ (sha 27fe16268ac8; run through the project's run commands)
log: last 5 of 5 entries in @log-recent; the full history is goals/G-002-final-boss/log.md

## You may write

- goals/G-002-final-boss/goal.md
- goals/G-002-final-boss/08-game-director-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to and any Sender assessment)
- project.md: only in the Route that closes the Goal, and only its ## Current state (at most 1,500 characters)
- goals/G-002-final-boss/NN-studio-to-<role or owner>.md: up to 3 new artifacts, consecutive NN starting at 09
- @need: instead of all other files, once: a file block `<<<FILE @need` with one path per line (up to 8 project or Studio files), then `>>>END`, to add them to this packet before you route

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create as one complete file block: `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the
  full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line. To change part of an existing file, you may
  instead write `<<<EDIT <path>` with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> REPLACE` pairs and
  `>>>END` (Output protocol); each SEARCH must match the file exactly once, so include enough
  lines. Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project
  directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record (current state and route plan) and an append-only Goal log (history). | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md`, `log.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

`goal.md` holds the Goal's current state; its history is the **Goal log**, `log.md` in the
Goal's directory. After every Intake, Route and Resume, whoever runs the operation appends one
entry (an isolated runtime does it itself): the operation and date, the Goal's status and open
steps, and the *Route changes* text just written. Entries are never edited or removed, and no Role
or Studio operation rewrites the log. Every operation keeps *Owner request* exactly as quoted at
Intake. Only Resume, after an Owner decision, may change *Interpretation*; a Route that would need
to reinterpret the Goal escalates instead.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the last few entries of the Goal log, the latest Handoff, this file,
`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps 4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the
files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and say why under
   *Route changes* in one to three lines (600 characters at most), replacing the previous text
   (the Goal log keeps the history; the Handoffs carry the details). Keep *Unknowns* current the
   same way: update a stage's line, do not narrate earlier passes. Confirm (`planned`) or drop
   (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition this result settles. The route is a plan,
   not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).
Then bring `project.md`'s `## Current state` up to date with what exists now (build, content,
known problems, how to run it; 1,500 characters at most), so the next Goal starts from the facts.
Nothing else in `project.md` changes: the rest belongs to the Owner.

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.
4. One question at a time: while an Escalation is open, do not open another. Later questions wait
   for the answer, or go into the next Escalation once it is resolved.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff. A Decision is never
edited once written, not even for a typo or a stray line: a change is a new Decision that
`supersedes:` it, so do not route an edit of one to a Role.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

<!-- Written in the project's owner_language. -->

## Question

<One sentence the Owner can answer without reading anything else.>

## Why this needs the Owner

<Which escalation trigger fires (studio/orchestration.md) and why the Studio must not decide.>

## Options

### Option A — <name>

<What it means for the game, cost, risk, reversibility.>
If chosen: <the route the Studio takes next.>

### Option B — <name>

<…>
If chosen: <…>

## Studio recommendation

<Option X.>

## Reasoning

<Why, and what evidence would change the recommendation.>

## Meanwhile

<Independent work that continues, or "Nothing; all remaining steps depend on this answer.">

## Owner decision required

<A / B — reply with the option and any conditions.>

## Owner request

> <the Owner's words, verbatim>

## Interpretation

<The Goal as an observable success condition. What is out of scope.>

## Unknowns

<Each stage entry question (studio/workflows/development-loop.md) that the Project Context cannot
answer, and the stage it creates. Also: stages skipped and why. Current state, not history: when a
stage runs again, update its line instead of adding the story of earlier passes, and drop settled
items (3,000 characters at most).>

## Route

| # | Stage | Role | Skills | Status | Handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <stage> | <role-id> | <skill-id> | planned | — |

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. Handoff: the file name (in this goal's directory)
of the incoming Handoff that starts the step. Parallel steps: 2a, 2b. Step numbers need not
match Handoff seq numbers. Role: exactly one role id per row; a parallel step gets its own row.
Keep Stage and Status cells short (80 characters at most); details belong in the Handoffs. The
route is a plan; the Route operation revises it.

## Route changes

<This operation's change only, in 1–3 lines (600 characters at most): after which step, what
changed, and why. Replace the previous text; the full history is in `log.md`.>

## Next action

<Who starts what next, with which Handoff. Or: waiting for the Owner on <escalation>.>

## Outcome

<At close, for the Owner, in owner_language: results, Decisions made, next issues, Owner items.>

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample, playable)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.4 in `repo/`: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player
kit of attack and dash. Build 0.4 fixed damage during a dash. A play session is an input script
(`repo/manual.md`): `run_play` shows what a player sees, `run_trace` the simulation state, and
`run_tests` runs the build's tests. `run_bots` lets the team's balance bots play rooms and reports
clear times, hearts lost and actions used (`repo/bots.py`).

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.
- `repo/manual.md` — controls, the play script format and reaction rules (player-facing; ships
  with the build).

# G-002: 最後に手応えのあるボス戦

## Owner request

> 最後に手応えのあるボス戦がほしい

## Interpretation

既存の第1〜4部屋を連続して進み、第5部屋を置き換えた単体ボスへ到達する。プレイヤーが位置取り、攻撃とダッシュのタイミング、敵の挙動への対応を通じて手応えを感じられる最終戦とし、最終勝利・死亡・ランの最初からの再挑戦まで成立する。短いランと、被害を受ける前に脅威を読み取れる体験を維持する。

D-015により、連続ラン・部屋間継承・終端・再挑戦の新設を今回の範囲に含める。具体的なボスの仕組み、難度、数値基準、継承・終端の詳細は担当Roleが定める。第1〜4部屋の構成と既存の共有戦闘ルールを維持し、新しい戦闘入力、ボス専用チェックポイント、既存部屋の全面改修は対象外。15〜20分を満たすためだけの敵HP増加は含めない。承認範囲を超える規模・費用・リスクや既存Decisionとの衝突が判明した場合は、実装前にOwnerへ戻す。

## Unknowns

- Observe：既存の不具合報告ではないため skipped。実行による現状確認は未実施。
- Diagnose：done。静的調査では連続ラン・部屋間継承・最終勝利・専用リトライがない。指定shaとの一致、実行時の終端挙動、戦闘時間は未確認。調査の制限は04に記録。
- Decide：D-015でOwnerが案Aを承認。第5部屋の単体ボスへの置換と連続ランを前提に、Game Directorが権限内の方向Decisionと設計への境界を確定する。
- Design：ボスの攻撃構成、予兆と対処、時間配分、部屋間継承、勝敗・残弾・終端後操作・再挑戦、受け入れ基準の仕様化が必要。
- Plan：確定仕様に基づき、進行・攻撃切替・表示・終端・時刻と入力の契約、共有コードへの影響、工数と依存を確認する必要がある。承認を超える規模なら実装前にOwnerへ戻す。
- Build：仕様と計画の確定後にゲーム変更が必要。
- Verify：Build後の独立確認が必要。30/60 FPS、連続到達・勝敗・再挑戦、共有戦闘ルールの回帰を含む。Art Directorの表現確認は攻撃・表示仕様で必要性が確定するまで tentative。
- Play：最終戦と到達体験の手応え、連続ランの所要時間を独立したプレイヤー観察で評価する。実装内容や期待結果は渡さない。
- Review：体験Goalの達成判断が必要。
- Next：結果と残課題をOwnerへ返す。

逐次実行する。Ownerが選択した案Aの経路に従い、方向Decisionの後にDesign・Planへ進む。Art DirectorのVerifyは攻撃・表示仕様に応じて確定する。現時点で並列Stepは開かない。

## Route changes

Ownerの案A承認をD-015に記録し、06をresolved、Goalをactiveへ変更。連続ラン・第5部屋の単体ボス・ラン先頭からの再挑戦をInterpretationに明記し、07でGame Directorの方向Decisionを開く。その後はDesign→Plan→Build→Verify→Play→Reviewと進める。

## Next action

Game Directorが `07-studio-to-game-director.md` を実行し、D-015の承認範囲内で方向Decisionを記録して、設計への指示とともにStudioへ返す。Studioが次のDesignを開く。現時点では実装を開始しない。

## Outcome

未完了・進行中。Ownerは案Aを承認し、D-015として記録した。連続ラン、第5部屋の単体ボス、最終勝利・死亡、ラン先頭からの再挑戦を今回の範囲に含める。方向Decision、仕様確定、実装計画、実装、検証、体験評価はこれから行う。指定shaとの一致や実行挙動は未確認であり、静的調査は実行成功やQA合格を示さない。Goalは閉じず、project.mdのCurrent stateは変更しない。

# 08: game-director → studio — 最終戦の体験方向を確定し、Designへ進める

## Task

D-016を方向として、Game Designerへボスと連続ランの仕様化をルーティングする。仕様化後はTechnical DirectorのPlanで範囲・費用・依存を評価し、実装の前提を整える。

## Context

Owner要望は「最後に手応えのあるボス戦がほしい」。D-015で、連続ラン、第5部屋の単体ボス、最終勝利・死亡、ラン先頭からの再挑戦が承認された。

今回はその範囲内の体験優先度と境界をD-016に記録した。詳細設計、技術方式、実装、QA、Goal達成判定は行っていない。

## Findings

### 確定した方向

最終戦は、危険を読んで位置を選び、回避から反撃へ戻る判断を問う山場とする。難度のために読みやすさを犠牲にせず、単なるHP増加や同じ回答の長時間反復を避ける。

連続到達と再挑戦も評価対象である。Designは前半の行動の意味と、ボスで対処を学ぶ余地を両立する継承・回復を定める。具体的な回復方式、攻撃数、フェーズ数、数値は未採択である。

### Designに必要な成果

- 第4部屋からの接続、ボス開始状態、攻撃構成、予兆、照準固定、危険範囲、対処、攻撃機会、中断可否を仕様化する。既習の読み取りをどう活用し、どの判断で山場を作るか説明する。
- 部屋順序、遷移条件、hearts・位置・向き・タイマー・弾・保持入力・予約入力・反応ルールの継承／リセットを明記する。
- 部屋クリアと最終勝利を区別し、同時勝利／死亡、残弾、終端後の進行と操作、再挑戦手段、再挑戦時の初期化を定める。ラン先頭から再挑戦する境界は変更しない。
- 部屋内時刻とラン時刻、入力の時刻基準、ポーズの扱い、時間切れと勝敗の区別を定める。現行ビルドにポーズや実機入力層があると仮定せず、必要な対応をPlanへの依存として示す。
- player viewで攻撃種、予兆と危険範囲、回復機会、ボスの残り耐久、進行・勝敗・再挑戦をどう認識できるか定める。現在のテキスト表示で成立する要求とし、表現上の不足があればArt Directorへの限定依頼を提案する。
- 30/60 FPSそれぞれで独立検証できる受け入れ基準を作る。攻撃・保護・接触消費などの共有ルール、連続到達、境界、勝敗、再挑戦の確認を含める。新攻撃へ既存の接触端例外を自動適用しない。
- ボスとランの時間目標を置く場合は、暫定値の根拠と実測後の見直し条件を示す。独立した部屋のbots時間合算を連続ラン実測に使わない。

### 旧第5部屋と既存Decisionの扱い

旧第5部屋の混成構成・配置、そのブルート位置、旧混成戦を前提とする評価は置換対象である。旧第5部屋を含むdodger比較や3〜5部屋合計の成績は、そのまま新ボスや連続ランの合格条件にしない。

ただし、基準本文は今回の入力にないため、基準番号ごとの削除・置換は確定していない。Studioは次のDesignに現行戦闘仕様、該当基準とテストを渡し、保持・置換・要Decision変更の対応表を作らせる。

特に次を区別する。

- D-004：第4部屋のcue gap、ブルートの非中断、その他の既存敵ルールを維持する。旧第5部屋からスピッターを取り除くことは、共有ルールの撤回やボスへの自動適用を意味しない。
- D-005：既存の弾消費・突進の一撃消費・接触判定を維持する。新しい攻撃にも適用関係を明記し、難度のために暗黙変更しない。
- D-006：3〜5部屋のwalker合計と2部屋クリアという基準は、独立した旧部屋と各3 heartsを前提とする。置換後への有効性は未確認であり、7を新ボスや連続ランへ移植しない。対応表でD-006に関わる変更を明示し、適切な権限で解決する。本Stepでは廃止・改訂しない。

### 証拠の限界とPlanへの依存

play／botsは今回実行していない。04は静的所見であり、指定shaとの一致、既存テスト、player／trace、botsの成功を示さない。project.mdのbuild 0.4と他資料の0.6の差も未解決である。

Planでは対象ビルドの同定と基準資料の整合、単体敵の攻撃切替、進行・終端、表示、入力・時刻、実行上限、bots対応、共有コードへの影響を評価する。60秒上限の現行play経路で必要な長さを検証できると仮定しない。必要な実行・計測経路と工数・依存・リスクを示すこと。

## Decisions already made

- D-015：連続ラン、第5部屋の単体ボス、最終勝利・死亡、ラン先頭からの再挑戦をOwnerが承認。
- D-016：読み取り、位置取り、回避後の反撃を最終戦の中心とする。継承・回復の方式と詳細ルールはDesignに残す。
- D-001：戦闘の基本は攻撃とダッシュ。追加の戦闘入力はOwner承認が必要。
- D-004／D-005／D-006：既存Decisionとして存続。第5部屋置換に伴う適用関係と必要な変更は個別に特定する。

## Constraints

- 第1〜4部屋の構成と共有戦闘ルールを維持する。
- ボス専用チェックポイント、追加の戦闘入力、第6部屋、通常敵との同居、既存部屋の全面改修を含めない。
- 15〜20分のVisionを維持し、時間合わせだけのHP増加や待機の水増しを行わない。
- Desktopのキーボード／ゲームパッド、30/60 FPSへの対応を要求として維持する。現行で実装済みとは扱わない。
- 承認範囲を超える規模・費用・リスク、Owner DecisionまたはVisionの変更が必要なら、実装前にOwnerへ戻す。
- 今回は新たなOwner判断を要する具体的な衝突は確定していない。DesignとPlanを進める。
- 独立QA、独立Play、Reviewを省略しない。Playtesterへの引き継ぎには実装内容や期待結果を渡さない。

## Open questions

1. どの攻撃構成と攻撃機会が、通常戦と異なる判断を生むか。
2. どの継承・回復ルールが、道中の意味とボスでの学習余地を両立するか。
3. 勝敗、残弾、終端後操作、再挑戦、時刻と入力の契約をどう仕様化するか。
4. 旧第5部屋依存のどの基準を置換し、どのDecisionに別途変更が必要か。
5. 表現仕様にArt Directorの参加が必要か。
6. Planで承認範囲内の実現性と検証経路を確保できるか。連続ランの実測がVisionから外れた場合、どこまで範囲内で調整できるか。

## Expected output

StudioはD-016と本Handoffを次のDesignへ渡す。Game Designerは詳細仕様、観測可能な受け入れ基準、旧基準とDecisionの対応表、未解決の依存を作成しStudioへ返す。

その後、Technical DirectorがPlanを行う。範囲・費用・依存の評価を経るまでBuildを開かず、Owner判断を要する拡大や衝突があれば具体的な変更と影響を添えて戻す。続く経路はBuild → 独立QA → 必要に応じたArt Director確認 → 独立Play → Reviewとする。Goalは未達成・進行中として維持する。
