# Combat design note: room 3 shots in flight after cap delays (step 46, build 0.6)

Status: amends criterion 11 of `design/combat.md` and the "Cap" paragraph. Where this note and `combat.md` differ on criterion 11 or the cap, this note governs. No rule, parameter or room changes. Fold this text into `combat.md` the next time that file is edited. Decision: D-007 (follow-up to D-005 item 4). Step 54 reworded criterion 11d only (how the count is read in the text view); the bound is unchanged.

## Question

QA (43): in a real room 3 with a surviving, dashing player, the shot cap delays all three second cues. At 6.8 s all three spitters start cues together and shoot together at 7.4 s (and again at 11.0 s / 11.6 s). Up to 5 shots may be in the air, while criterion 11 says "rooms 1–5 never more than 3 in flight". Is that accepted, or does the rule change?

## Ruling

**Accepted. No rule change, no build change.** Criterion 11 was worded too strongly. It contradicted the cap rule in `combat.md`, which says the cap is a limit on cue starts, checked once, and not rechecked at the shot. The contradiction is in the criterion text, so the criterion is changed.

Why accepting is right:

- **The cue is the telegraph, and the cue always ends in a shot.** Refusing or dropping a shot whose cue is already showing would make cues lie. This is the reason given for the cap design in step 22 and it still holds.
- **Three simultaneous cues are readable.** Each spitter shows its own full-brightness line for the full 0.6 s. The three lines are locked on the same point, the player's position at 6.8 s, and meet only there. A player who moves about 1 tile off that point, away from all three lines, clears all three. A dash clears any line it crosses. Shots travel at 3.0 tiles/s, so even when fired together they arrive at different times, spread by their different distances (a 12-tile path takes 4 s). The player never has to answer three arrivals at one instant. This is derived from geometry, not observed with a human.
- **The case is narrow.** It needs a player who keeps all shots alive in the air for several seconds, usually by never killing a spitter (HP 2, stationary, swipeable at any time). It is not the normal way to play room 3. It was seen with a scripted dasher that is not hit.
- **A fix would change a verified room.** The only consistent fix is to extend the cue gap rule to room 3 with a 0.2 s minimum gap (see "Prepared fallback"). It would alter room 3 behavior after any cap delay, and criteria 13, 15, 16 and 18 would need re-measuring. That cost is not justified by an unconfirmed player problem.

The other options were considered and not taken:

- Re-checking the cap at shot release: shots would be dropped or delayed after the cue showed them. That breaks "the cue ends in the shot" and makes cues lie.
- A lower cap for room 3: it makes room 3 delays longer and more frequent, and moves it away from the room that teaches the cue.
- Staggering delayed cues by a fixed gap: this is the prepared fallback, not taken now.

## Amended criterion 11 (replaces the "never more than 3" sentence in `combat.md`)

**11. Stagger and cap.**

- a. Room 3: the first shots are at 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s ±1 frame. Rooms 4 and 5: the first shots are at 1.8 and 3.0 s ±1 frame, as long as both spitters are alive and the cap has not delayed a cue (it cannot by then). Unchanged.
- b. **Cue starts.** A spitter may start a cue only if fewer than 3 shots are in flight at that moment, at both rates, in every room and in a practice room. Otherwise it waits 0.2 s and checks again.
- c. **Shots in flight.** The number of shots in flight never exceeds 2 plus the number of living spitters, at both rates:
  - Rooms 4 and 5: never more than 3, because cue windows never overlap (criterion 18a).
  - Room 3: up to 5 is accepted, when the cap delays several cues together (up to 2 already in flight at the check, plus one shot from each of three spitters).
  - Practice room with four or more spitters: up to 2 plus the number of living spitters, as before.
- d. **Observation of the count (reworded in step 54).** In `play --view player`, run the QA 43 room 3 script (real room 3, `when see * coming within 2 then dash aside`, 15 s) at 30 and 60 FPS. The player view prints a picture every 0.5 s, so the count is taken at the printed pictures at **7.5 s and 12.0 s**, not at 11.7 s (no picture is printed there). The count at a picture is:
  - **shots in flight = the `*` marks visible in that picture + the number of `a spitter spits` events in the 0.3 s up to and including the picture time.**
  - The second term exists because a shot within one cell of its spitter is drawn as `s`, not `*`, so it is not visible as a mark for its first moments (3.0 tiles/s, about 0.1–0.3 s). Spit events are in the printed messages; they are not a new build output.
  - Expected: 3 to 5 at 7.5 s (QA 50: 2 visible + 3 spits at 7.400 = 5) and 3 at 12.0 s (QA 50: 3 visible, the spits at 11.600 are 0.4 s old and already drawn as `*`, so the spit term adds 0). A derived count within 3 to 5 in room 3 is a pass; 4 or 5 needs no report. A count above 5 in room 3, or above 3 in rooms 4–5, is a build defect. A literal `*` count below 3 is not a verdict by itself; QA records the visible marks, the spit events counted, and the derived total for both rates.
  - A derived count is an accepted method for 11d. It is a derivation from printed text, and QA states it as such.
- e. Cue timing (criterion 9) holds at every cue, including the simultaneous ones: each cue is 0.6 s ±1 frame before its own shot and each shot goes along its own locked line.

## Hand-timed playtest of room 3

The hand-timed playtest is the check of whether a human can answer the burst. It follows the Build and re-verify, together with the other playtest items already open. The tester plays room 3 and, as one variant, avoids killing the spitters for about 12 s so that a cap delay occurs.

Outcomes that reopen this ruling:

1. The tester is hit by 2 or 3 of the 3 shots of a simultaneous volley, in at least half of the volleys they see, even though they saw the cues.
2. The tester says a shot "came out of nowhere" or cannot say which line to leave in a simultaneous volley.
3. A real-room trace of room 3 shows a count above 5, or a simultaneous start in room 3 at a time before any cap delay.

If none occurs, this ruling stands.

## Prepared fallback (not specified for the build now)

If the playtest reopens this: extend the cue gap rule of rooms 4–5 to room 3 with a minimum gap of **0.2 s** (a spitter starts a cue only if no other cue is running and the last shot in the room was at least 0.2 s ago, with the 1 ms tolerance). The mechanism is the same as in rooms 4–5, with a per-room gap parameter. This reproduces the verified first-shot schedule exactly (cues 1.2–1.8, 2.0–2.6, 2.8–3.4 s) and removes simultaneous starts after a cap delay. It also makes the in-flight bound 3 in room 3. Criteria 11, 13, 15, 16 and 18 would be re-verified for rooms 3–5. This needs its own spec step and a Decision that supersedes D-005 item 4.

## Build change list

**None for this item.** The enemy code does not change. The Build for this handoff is F2 and F3 only (see handoff 46). Step 54: no trace field or other build change is needed for 11d.

## Re-verification needed because of this ruling

- Criterion 11 against the amended wording (a–e above). For 11d, QA's step 50 figures already give 5 at 7.5 s and 3 at 12.0 s at both rates; no new run is needed unless the build changes.
- Nothing else. No parameter, rule or room changed, so the criterion 13, 14, 15 and 18 figures are unaffected.

## Undefined or not observed

- The count of 5 shots is derived from timings and printed events, not observed as 5 marks. This is the accepted method (11d).
- The assumption that a freshly fired shot stays hidden under `s` for at most 0.3 s is derived from speed and cell size. If a spit event older than 0.3 s is still hidden, QA records it and the window is widened by a spec step.
- Whether a human can answer the burst is derived from geometry, not observed. The playtest settles it.
- Criteria 2, 6, 10, 17 (a–d), 19f, the isolated runner dash in 3, the runner's one-swipe death in 8, rooms 1–2 contents in 12, 18c with a killed spitter, 20e, 20f, 21b and the 16e decision logs are not affected by this ruling and stay on the re-verify list.

## Experience signal (playtest and Review)

A player in room 3 who sees several cues at once can say which lines are coming and moves out of them. They do not describe a burst of shots as unfair or hidden.
