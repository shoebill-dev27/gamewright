"""Balance bots: let simple player strategies play rooms and report how they fared.

usage: python3 bots.py SCRIPT

Script lines (all optional; `#` starts a comment):
  bots camper,walker,dodger   which bots play (default: all)
  rooms 1-5                   which rooms, as a range or a list like 1,3,5 (default: 1-5)
  fps 60                      30 or 60 (default: 60)
  limit 60                    seconds a bot may take per room (default: 60)
  pause_at 30                 mode run: pause once when run time reaches this many seconds
  pause_seconds 5             mode run: driver seconds spent paused (never added to run time)
  retries 2                   mode run: retries allowed after a won/dead attempt (default 0)
  log on                      print each bot's decisions under its room line: time, what it did,
                              and the state it decided from (after " | "); skipped decisions and
                              every heart lost are logged too

Each bot starts every room with full hearts. Bots decide at most once every 0.15 s of game time
(accumulated seconds, on a fixed time grid), so a bot behaves the same at 30 and 60 FPS apart from
frame rounding. The walker and camper do not read the new cues; the dodger does.
