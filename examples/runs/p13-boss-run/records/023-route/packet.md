## You may write

- goals/G-002-final-boss/goal.md
- goals/G-002-final-boss/18-game-director-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to and any Sender assessment)
- project.md: only in the Route that closes the Goal, and only its ## Current state (at most 1,500 characters)
- goals/G-002-final-boss/NN-studio-to-<role or owner>.md: up to 3 new artifacts, consecutive NN starting at 19
- @need: instead of all other files, once: a file block `<<<FILE @need` with one path per line (up to 8 project or Studio files), then `>>>END`, to add them to this packet before you route

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create as one complete file block: `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the
  full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line. To change part of an existing file, you may
  instead write `<<<EDIT <path>` with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> REPLACE` pairs and
  `>>>END` (Output protocol); each SEARCH must match the file exactly once, so include enough
  lines. Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project
  directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record (current state and route plan) and an append-only Goal log (history). | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md`, `log.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

`goal.md` holds the Goal's current state; its history is the **Goal log**, `log.md` in the
Goal's directory. After every Intake, Route and Resume, whoever runs the operation appends one
entry (an isolated runtime does it itself): the operation and date, the Goal's status and open
steps, and the *Route changes* text just written. Entries are never edited or removed, and no Role
or Studio operation rewrites the log. Every operation keeps *Owner request* exactly as quoted at
Intake. Only Resume, after an Owner decision, may change *Interpretation*; a Route that would need
to reinterpret the Goal escalates instead.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the last few entries of the Goal log, the latest Handoff, this file,
`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps 4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the
files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and say why under
   *Route changes* in one to three lines (600 characters at most), replacing the previous text
   (the Goal log keeps the history; the Handoffs carry the details). Keep *Unknowns* current the
   same way: update a stage's line, do not narrate earlier passes. Confirm (`planned`) or drop
   (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition this result settles. The route is a plan,
   not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).
Then bring `project.md`'s `## Current state` up to date with what exists now (build, content,
known problems, how to run it; 1,500 characters at most), so the next Goal starts from the facts.
Nothing else in `project.md` changes: the rest belongs to the Owner.

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.
4. One question at a time: while an Escalation is open, do not open another. Later questions wait
   for the answer, or go into the next Escalation once it is resolved.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff. A Decision is never
edited once written, not even for a typo or a stray line: a change is a new Decision that
`supersedes:` it, so do not route an edit of one to a Role.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# NN: Owner decision needed — <question in a few words>

<!-- Written in the project's owner_language. -->

## Question

<One sentence the Owner can answer without reading anything else.>

## Why this needs the Owner

<Which escalation trigger fires (studio/orchestration.md) and why the Studio must not decide.>

## Options

### Option A — <name>

<What it means for the game, cost, risk, reversibility.>
If chosen: <the route the Studio takes next.>

### Option B — <name>

<…>
If chosen: <…>

## Studio recommendation

<Option X.>

## Reasoning

<Why, and what evidence would change the recommendation.>

## Meanwhile

<Independent work that continues, or "Nothing; all remaining steps depend on this answer.">

## Owner decision required

<A / B — reply with the option and any conditions.>

# G-NNN: <short title>

## Owner request

> <the Owner's words, verbatim>

## Interpretation

<The Goal as an observable success condition. What is out of scope.>

## Unknowns

<Each stage entry question (studio/workflows/development-loop.md) that the Project Context cannot
answer, and the stage it creates. Also: stages skipped and why. Current state, not history: when a
stage runs again, update its line instead of adding the story of earlier passes, and drop settled
items (3,000 characters at most).>

## Route

| # | Stage | Role | Skills | Status | Handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <stage> | <role-id> | <skill-id> | planned | — |

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. Handoff: the file name (in this goal's directory)
of the incoming Handoff that starts the step. Parallel steps: 2a, 2b. Step numbers need not
match Handoff seq numbers. Role: exactly one role id per row; a parallel step gets its own row.
Keep Stage and Status cells short (80 characters at most); details belong in the Handoffs. The
route is a plan; the Route operation revises it.

## Route changes

<This operation's change only, in 1–3 lines (600 characters at most): after which step, what
changed, and why. Replace the previous text; the full history is in `log.md`.>

## Next action

<Who starts what next, with which Handoff. Or: waiting for the Owner on <escalation>.>

## Outcome

<At close, for the Owner, in owner_language: results, Decisions made, next issues, Owner items.>

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample, playable)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.4 in `repo/`: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player
kit of attack and dash. Build 0.4 fixed damage during a dash. A play session is an input script
(`repo/manual.md`): `run_play` shows what a player sees, `run_trace` the simulation state, and
`run_tests` runs the build's tests. `run_bots` lets the team's balance bots play rooms and reports
clear times, hearts lost and actions used (`repo/bots.py`).

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.
- `repo/manual.md` — controls, the play script format and reaction rules (player-facing; ships
  with the build).

# G-002: 最後に手応えのあるボス戦

## Owner request

> 最後に手応えのあるボス戦がほしい

## Interpretation

既存の第1〜4部屋を連続して進み、第5部屋を置き換えた単体ボスへ到達する。プレイヤーが位置取り、攻撃とダッシュのタイミング、敵の挙動への対応を通じて手応えを感じられる最終戦とし、最終勝利・死亡・ランの最初からの再挑戦まで成立する。短いランと、被害を受ける前に脅威を読み取れる体験を維持する。

D-015により、連続ラン・部屋間継承・終端・再挑戦の新設を今回の範囲に含める。具体的なボスの仕組み、難度、数値基準、継承・終端の詳細は担当Roleが定める。第1〜4部屋の構成と既存の共有戦闘ルールを維持し、新しい戦闘入力、ボス専用チェックポイント、既存部屋の全面改修は対象外。15〜20分を満たすためだけの敵HP増加は含めない。承認範囲を超える規模・費用・リスクや既存Decisionとの衝突が判明した場合は、実装前にOwnerへ戻す。

## Unknowns

- Observe：既存の不具合報告ではないため skipped。実行による現状確認は未実施。
- Diagnose：done。静的調査では連続ラン・部屋間継承・最終勝利・専用リトライがない。指定shaとの一致、実行時の終端挙動、戦闘時間は未確認。調査の制限は04に記録。
- Decide：done。D-015でOwnerが連続ランと第5部屋の単体ボスを承認。D-016で読み取り・位置取り・回避後の反撃を中心とする方向と設計境界を確定。既存Decisionは存続し、旧第5部屋依存の基準への適用関係はDesignで整理する。
- Design：done。D-017とfinal-boss-and-continuous-run.mdで詳細契約、30/60 FPSの受け入れ基準、旧基準対応表を確定。未実装・未検証。
- Decide（既存Decisionとの整合）：done。D-018で旧集計を新構成の評価から分離する方向を確定。D-006自体の適用変更は未完了。
- Design補足：done。D-019と仕様§8・§10で旧集計の適用終了、保持する回帰、ボスdash検証、対応botのFPS比較条件、実測後のDesigner再判断を確定。過去G-001の判断・結果は保持する。
- Plan：技術計画は16に提出済みだが開始条件は未充足。指定sha・実行基線、回帰正本の読み込み、desktop実機ホスト・独立検証環境が未確認。Build暫定11.5〜20人日、独立検証は別枠で、承認範囲内とは未判断。Buildは保留する。
- Decide（実装開始条件）：open。Game Directorが16の実機ホスト追加・費用・環境依存をD-015／D-016の承認範囲と照合する。範囲内の判断とRoleで解決可能な調査を分け、承認超過またはRoleでは供給できない環境が必要ならOwnerへの具体的なEscalationを作る。未確認だけを超過確定とは扱わない。
- Design（実測後）：planned。対応botの両FPS基線、独立QA・Play、通常ランの同一試行による到達・終端・時間実測を受け、Review前に追加数値ゲート・調整の要否を判断する。不要でも理由を記録する。明白な対処不能・到達不能はPlay前に戻す。
- Build：仕様と計画の確定後にゲーム変更が必要。
- Verify：Build後の独立QAが必要。30/60 FPS、連続到達・勝敗・再挑戦、共有戦闘ルールの回帰、実機入力経路を含む。Art Directorの限定表現確認をplannedに確定。player viewの二攻撃、予兆と実弾、回復、HP、終端・retryの識別を対象とする。
- Play：最終戦と到達体験の手応え、連続ランの所要時間を独立したプレイヤー観察で評価する。実装内容や期待結果は渡さない。
- Review：体験Goalの達成判断が必要。
- Next：結果と残課題をOwnerへ返す。

逐次実行する。17で実機ホスト・費用・環境依存の扱いをGame Directorへ戻す。判断後、Technical Directorが実行基線と環境・依存を確認し、計画を補完して開始可否を返す。必要なOwner判断とPlanの開始条件が解決する前にBuildを開かない。独立QA、Art Directorの限定Verify、独立Play、Designerの実測後判断、Reviewの順序を維持する。初回基線やQAで明白な対処不能・到達不能が判明した場合はDesigner判断を前倒しする。現時点で並列Stepは開かない。

## Route changes

16のPlan提出Stepを完了扱いとし、開始条件未充足によるBuild保留を記録。実機ホスト追加と暫定費用・環境依存の承認範囲判断を17でGame Directorへ戻す。判断後のPlan補完を追加し、独立検証・Play・Designer実測後判断を維持する。現時点で超過や環境供給不能は確定しておらず、Ownerへの質問はまだ開かない。

## Next action

Game Directorが `17-studio-to-game-director.md` を実行し、16の実機ホスト追加・費用・環境依存を承認範囲と照合する。権限内なら判断と後続調査条件をStudioへ返し、Owner判断が必要なら具体的なEscalationを作る。Buildは開始しない。

## Outcome

未完了・進行中。D-015〜D-019による範囲・方向・仕様・基準適用を維持する。16に技術計画と暫定Build費用11.5〜20人日が提出されたが、独立検証は別枠で、実機入力環境と開始条件は未確認。次はGame Directorによる承認範囲・依存の判断。実装、独立検証、Play、Designer実測後判断、Reviewは未実施。指定sha一致、実行成功、難度、所要時間の新しい証拠はない。Ownerへの新たな質問はまだ開かず、project.mdのCurrent stateは変更しない。

# 18: game-director → studio — 最小ホストの位置付けとPlan補完・Build保留条件

## Task

D-020に従い、Technical Directorへ限定したPlan補完をルーティングする。実行基線、回帰正本、実機環境の供給、費用承認の根拠を揃え、解決できないOwner権限の問題は具体化してGame Directorへ戻す。

## Context

OwnerはD-015で連続ラン、第5部屋の単体ボス、ラン先頭からの再挑戦を承認した。16の技術計画は提出済みだが、実行基線・実機環境・費用が未確認で、Buildは開始していない。

本Stepは承認範囲の解釈と次の調査条件を決めた。技術方式、詳細仕様、実装、検証の代行はしていない。

## Findings

### 承認範囲の判断

D-020を採択した。desktopのkeyboard／gamepadは既存要件であり、その操作・表示に必要な最小ホストをPlanで検討することは、Goalの追加ではない。ホスト新設の必要性と、費用・リスクの承認は別に判断する。

16のBuild準備〜統合11.5〜20人日にはホスト2〜4人日が含まれる。独立QA 2〜3、限定Art 0.5〜1、独立Play 1〜2を加えると提示済み部分は15〜26人日である。これは確約でも総費用でもない。Designer判断、修正・再検証、機器・ライセンス等の金銭費用は未算入または未確認で、予算上限もない。

現時点で承認超過・環境供給不能が確定したとは判断しない。OwnerへのEscalationはまだ作らず、無条件のBuild許可も出さない。

### 次のPlan補完で取得する最小の証拠

| 項目 | Technical Directorが確認する事項 | Roleで解決できない場合の返却内容 |
|---|---|---|
| 実行対象 | gitルート、対象commit、指定sha `27fe16268ac8`との関係、作業差分の有無、0.4／0.6表記の由来 | 必要なcheckout・資料・権限と、取得できない理由 |
| 実行基線 | Python版・既存依存、既存tests、player／trace、各botの30/60 FPS結果。実行条件・終了理由・失敗を記録 | 利用可能な実行経路と不足。静的所見を実行済みにしない |
| 回帰正本 | combat.md、step44、step46、step68、step72、step94、関連Decisionと実テストを読み、保持／終了／置換先を照合 | 未提供の正本を特定。未読を不存在としない |
| 実機環境 | 利用可能なdesktop OS・表示環境、keyboard／gamepadの種類、既存依存、導入権限、独立検証担当・利用条件 | 必要なOS・機器・権限・検証枠、既存資源で代替できない理由 |
| ホスト計画 | 共通Sessionへの接続、実機入力・表示・記録、保持入力解除、30/60 FPSと実時間pause確認の実現方式 | 最小方式でも残る制約・リスクと代替案 |
| 費用・承認 | 環境確認後の見積もり、前提・除外・不確実性、独立検証・Designer判断・修正枠、金銭費用の有無、既存承認との対応 | Ownerに承認を求める具体的な幅・必要物・未確定部分 |

既存資源の調査と、新たな供給の確約を分ける。OS、機器、予算上限、導入権限をRoleが推定・創作して埋めない。既存の権限内で確認できればOwnerへ質問する必要はない。購入、追加予算、権限付与、Roleでは確保できない検証環境などが必要なら、供給権限を持つ相手を特定する。

### 返却条件とBuild保留解除

Plan補完は、各依存について「確認済みの証拠」「残る不足」「解決する担当・経路」を示して返す。実行不能なら、不能の証拠と必要な供給物を返すことで調査結果とするが、開始条件の充足にはしない。

BuildはD-020の五条件がすべて解決した後にStudioが開く。特に、予算資料がないまま見積もりを承認内と認定しない。既存承認だけで費用・リスクを判断できなければ、環境確認済みの最小案と見積もりを添えてGame Directorへ戻す。

Owner権限の問題が具体化した場合は、次のEscalationを作れる形で返す。

- 一つの判断対象：必要な供給・費用を伴う現行仕様の継続を認めるか。
- 必要な機器・OS・依存権限・独立検証枠、費用幅と未確定部分。
- 供給して継続、必要なら追加調査、範囲変更、停止のうち現実的な2〜3案と各ルート。
- 推奨と、その推奨を変える証拠。

範囲変更はOwner判断後にDesigner／Technical Directorへ戻す。V2を任意化したり、headlessのみで満たした扱いにしたりしない。

### 証拠の限界

本Stepは提供パケットのみを使用し、play／botsを実行していない。指定sha一致、実行成功、実機供給、難度、時間の新しい証拠はない。

make-decisionとprepare-owner-escalationが参照するstudio/orchestration.mdはパケットに含まれていない。D-015と17に明記された承認超過・Owner権限の境界で判断した。Studioは次のLoadへ同文書を追加し、他の適用トリガーがあればBuild前に解決する。

## Decisions already made

- D-015：連続ラン、第5部屋単体ボス、先頭retryをOwnerが承認。承認超過は実装前に戻す。
- D-016：読み取り、位置取り、回避後の反撃を優先し、既存部屋・共有規則と再利用方針を維持。
- D-017：ボス・ラン・入力・表示・終端の詳細契約。実機入力と長時間検証はPlan依存。
- D-019：旧集計の適用整理、保持回帰、ボス対応bot比較、Review前のDesigner実測後判断。
- D-020：最小ホストを既存要件の実現作業としてPlanで検討する。費用承認は未確定。限定調査へ返し、開始条件の充足までBuildを保留。

## Constraints

- Owner request、Interpretation、D-015〜D-019、詳細仕様を変更しない。
- 技術方式はTechnical Directorが選ぶ。本判断はSDL系その他のライブラリを指定しない。
- 次Stepでゲーム・ホストの実装、新規依存導入、購入、外部費用の確約を行わない。
- 秘密情報、環境変数の値、個人情報を調査記録へ含めない。
- 過去Decision、G-001の結果、project.mdのCurrent stateを変更しない。
- Plan補完→Build→独立QA→限定Art Verify→独立Play→Designer実測後判断→Reviewを維持する。明白な対処不能・到達不能はPlay前でもDesignerへ戻す。
- 追加難度ゲートの未設定はD-019による実測後判断であり、それ自体をBuild阻害へ追加しない。

## Open questions

1. 実行対象・指定sha・Python基線・版表記の差を、どの証拠で確定できるか。
2. 利用可能なOS・機器・導入権限・独立実機検証枠でV2と実時間pause確認を実施できるか。追加供給が必要なら何か。
3. 環境確認後の見積もりと残る不確実性は何か。費用・リスクを既存承認内と判断する根拠はあるか、Ownerの具体的承認が必要か。

## Expected output

StudioはD-020を記録し、Technical DirectorへPlan補完をルーティングする。次のLoadには16の既存Loadに加え、D-020、studio/orchestration.md、未読の回帰正本step46・step68・step72・step94およびD-011〜D-014を、プロジェクト一覧の正確なパスで追加する。

Technical Directorの返却には、実行証拠、回帰対応、実機方式と供給条件、更新見積もり、承認根拠、各未解決依存とBuild開始可否を必要とする。取得不能の場合も必要物と解決経路を明記する。

Owner権限の問題が具体化したらGame Directorへ戻し、日本語の具体的なEscalationを準備する。それまではBuildを開かず、調査の完了と実装開始条件の充足を区別する。
