## You may write

- goals/G-002-final-boss/goal.md
- goals/G-002-final-boss/54-gameplay-engineer-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to and any Sender assessment)
- project.md: only in the Route that closes the Goal, and only its ## Current state (at most 1,500 characters)
- goals/G-002-final-boss/NN-studio-to-<role or owner>.md: up to 3 new artifacts, consecutive NN starting at 55

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create as one complete file block: `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the
  full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line. To change part of an existing file, you may
  instead write `<<<EDIT <path>` with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> REPLACE` pairs and
  `>>>END` (Output protocol); each SEARCH must match the file exactly once, so include enough
  lines. Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project
  directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record (current state and route plan) and an append-only Goal log (history). | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md`, `log.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

`goal.md` holds the Goal's current state; its history is the **Goal log**, `log.md` in the
Goal's directory. After every Intake, Route and Resume, whoever runs the operation appends one
entry (an isolated runtime does it itself): the operation and date, the Goal's status and open
steps, and the *Route changes* text just written. Entries are never edited or removed, and no Role
or Studio operation rewrites the log. Every operation keeps *Owner request* exactly as quoted at
Intake. Only Resume, after an Owner decision, may change *Interpretation*; a Route that would need
to reinterpret the Goal escalates instead.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the last few entries of the Goal log, the latest Handoff, this file,
`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps 4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the
files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and say why under
   *Route changes* in one to three lines (600 characters at most), replacing the previous text
   (the Goal log keeps the history; the Handoffs carry the details). Keep *Unknowns* current the
   same way: update a stage's line, do not narrate earlier passes. Confirm (`planned`) or drop
   (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition this result settles. The route is a plan,
   not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).
Then bring `project.md`'s `## Current state` up to date with what exists now (build, content,
known problems, how to run it; 1,500 characters at most), so the next Goal starts from the facts.
Nothing else in `project.md` changes: the rest belongs to the Owner.

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.
4. One question at a time: while an Escalation is open, do not open another. Later questions wait
   for the answer, or go into the next Escalation once it is resolved.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff. A Decision is never
edited once written, not even for a typo or a stray line: a change is a new Decision that
`supersedes:` it, so do not route an edit of one to a Role.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
- `partial` is not a question: nothing is missing, so route the rest of the work back to the same
  Role and never escalate for it. The same work handed back `partial` three times in a row →
  route to `technical-director` to split or re-plan it.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# NN: Owner decision needed — <question in a few words>

<!-- Written in the project's owner_language. -->

## Question

<One sentence the Owner can answer without reading anything else.>

## Why this needs the Owner

<Which escalation trigger fires (studio/orchestration.md) and why the Studio must not decide.>

## Options

### Option A — <name>

<What it means for the game, cost, risk, reversibility.>
If chosen: <the route the Studio takes next.>

### Option B — <name>

<…>
If chosen: <…>

## Studio recommendation

<Option X.>

## Reasoning

<Why, and what evidence would change the recommendation.>

## Meanwhile

<Independent work that continues, or "Nothing; all remaining steps depend on this answer.">

## Owner decision required

<A / B — reply with the option and any conditions.>

# G-NNN: <short title>

## Owner request

> <the Owner's words, verbatim>

## Interpretation

<The Goal as an observable success condition. What is out of scope.>

## Unknowns

<Each stage entry question (studio/workflows/development-loop.md) that the Project Context cannot
answer, and the stage it creates. Also: stages skipped and why. Current state, not history: when a
stage runs again, update its line instead of adding the story of earlier passes, and drop settled
items (3,000 characters at most).>

## Route

| # | Stage | Role | Skills | Status | Handoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <stage> | <role-id> | <skill-id> | planned | — |

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. Handoff: the file name (in this goal's directory)
of the incoming Handoff that starts the step. Parallel steps: 2a, 2b. Step numbers need not
match Handoff seq numbers. Role: exactly one role id per row; a parallel step gets its own row.
Keep Stage and Status cells short (80 characters at most); details belong in the Handoffs. The
route is a plan; the Route operation revises it.

## Route changes

<This operation's change only, in 1–3 lines (600 characters at most): after which step, what
changed, and why. Replace the previous text; the full history is in `log.md`.>

## Next action

<Who starts what next, with which Handoff. Or: waiting for the Owner on <escalation>.>

## Outcome

<At close, for the Owner, in owner_language: results, Decisions made, next issues, Owner items.>

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample, playable)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.4 in `repo/`: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player
kit of attack and dash. Build 0.4 fixed damage during a dash. A play session is an input script
(`repo/manual.md`): `run_play` shows what a player sees, `run_trace` the simulation state, and
`run_tests` runs the build's tests. `run_bots` lets the team's balance bots play rooms and reports
clear times, hearts lost and actions used (`repo/bots.py`).

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.
- `repo/manual.md` — controls, the play script format and reaction rules (player-facing; ships
  with the build).

既存の第1〜4部屋を連続して進み、第5部屋を置き換えた単体ボスへ到達する。プレイヤーが位置取り、攻撃とダッシュのタイミング、敵の挙動への対応を通じて手応えを感じられる最終戦とし、最終勝利・死亡・ランの最初からの再挑戦まで成立する。短いランと、被害を受ける前に脅威を読み取れる体験を維持する。

D-015により、連続ラン・部屋間継承・終端・再挑戦の新設を今回の範囲に含める。第1〜4部屋の構成と既存の共有戦闘ルールを維持し、新しい戦闘入力、ボス専用チェックポイント、既存部屋の全面改修は対象外。15〜20分を満たすためだけの敵HP増加は含めない。

D-021により、今回はrepo/のテキスト表示とスクリプト実行で実装・検証する。Desktop、keyboard、gamepadは製品対象であり、実機ホストや実gamepadの供給・検証を今回の要件としない。基線はrepo/の現状とし、指定sha確認は不要。独立QA・PlayはStudio内の別Stepが担う。購入・外部委託・追加金銭を使わず、通常Stepの範囲で進める。具体的な追加支出や承認範囲を超える変更が必要になった場合はOwnerへ戻す。

## Unknowns

# 54: gameplay-engineer → studio — D-022 observation implementation delivered

## Task

Inspect the appended final-source Build check. Route Split C only if the full suite is green, then route independent verification.

## Context

53 requested completion of D-022 observation controls, summaries, acceptance coverage and documentation after the intermediate 140-test build. The packet supplied a successful run of an unpersisted proposal; that result is distinguished from this saved delivery.

## Findings

Delivered files:

- `repo/play.py`: dispatches `view-every` to the public parser.
- `repo/run_driver.py`: validates numeric observation intervals, retains `trace-every frame`, bounds periodic output without thinning events, resets schedules on retry, and prints one final summary for both views.
- `repo/tests/test_d022_observation.py`: nine acceptance tests, independently exercised at 30 and 60 FPS where applicable.
- `repo/manual.md`, `repo/README.md`, `repo/public-driver.md`: interval syntax, summary fields, output bounds and remaining integration work.

Player-observable changes follow D-022: optional slower periodic pictures, unchanged immediate event messages, execution-time validation errors, and one final public summary. Default player cadence is retained. Default trace records retain their existing shape. Legacy output is unchanged beyond the previously delivered note.

Summaries cover every attempt: clear/death/unfinished outcome, run time, visited room times, first boss-entry hearts, hurts, attacks, pause count and duration, driver time, driver elapsed excluding pauses, processing seconds and source id. Execution stop remains separate from combat result.

Acceptance coverage includes L1 note/output/event/result/time equivalence and the unchanged 60-second cap, public boss/spitter shared shot numbering, O1 bounded periodic output, O2 event/result equivalence, O3 default/explicit half-second equivalence, O4 one summary at clear/death/limit with retry/pause accounting, O5 invalid intervals, and O6 controlled 1200-second executions.

Historical evidence supplied in this packet:

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`: 149 tests, exit 0, 2.299 seconds, proposal source `b337ca3e09cf`.

Separate controlled long observations in that run:

| FPS | View | Run seconds | Periodic output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | player | 1200 | 121 / 121 |
| 30 | trace | 1200 | 241 / 241 |
| 60 | player | 1200 | 121 / 121 |
| 60 | trace | 1200 | 241 / 241 |

That source is not claimed as this delivery's source. This delivery strengthens numeric-trace equivalence and malformed-interval coverage and retains default trace record shape. The runtime's appended Build check is the authoritative full-suite result for these saved sources. The long-observation test prints the final executed source id separately for each FPS/view pair, along with actual time and periodic counts. The full discovery command includes `tests/test_play_run_controls.py`.

These are automated Build probes, not independent verification or continuous reachability evidence. Long observations deliberately raise hearts to survive 1200 seconds in normal-run mode; they do not demonstrate normal survival, progression or completion. No new bot measurement is claimed.

Implementation and documentation are complete for this continuation. Split C measurements and independent verification remain later work. Any failure in the appended final-source check must be resolved before Split C.

## Decisions already made

- D-017: combat, progression, clocks, pause, retry and presentation.
- D-019: retained regressions, measurement and subsequent Designer judgment.
- D-021: text/script Build and Studio verification authorized.
- D-022: legacy note, developer shot lifecycle metadata and long observation controls.

## Constraints

Preserve rooms 1–4, shared combat rules and existing tests. Evaluate 30 and 60 FPS separately. Do not equate controlled survival with normal-run reachability. No purchases, outsourcing or additional expenditure. Independent QA, limited Art Verify and Play remain required.

## Open questions

None.

## Expected output

Studio inspects the appended full-suite result and final executed source id. If green, route Split C for normal-run pause/retry measurements and retained dodger rooms 1–4 regression fixation. Then route independent QA and subsequent verification and judgment steps. If the final-source suite fails, route the concrete failure for correction before Split C.

## Build check

The runtime ran `run_tests` (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`) on the build exactly as this step wrote it: exit 0 (2.4 s).

# 40: gameplay-engineer → studio — 保存版を実行: suite 112件OK、独立3・4／新5番／通常ランの測定を取得。V1補完・細目の契約試験・retry/pause計測は未実施

## Task

実行結果（source id `5145454ab956`）を受領する。独立QAへ送るか、先に未実施分（V1補完、契約試験の細目、retry/pause計測）を別Stepで補うかを判断する。新5番と通常ランの実測は、D-019に従いDesignerの「実測後判断」へルーティングする。

## Context

39は、38で提出した未実行の変更（source_id、boss対応dodger、開始hearts指定、play_run、test_bots_boss.py）を保存版で実行し、失敗を直し、測定を返すよう求めた。このStepでは@runで次の3種を実行した。

- tests
- 独立3・4、新5番、保持分のbots
- 通常ランのbots

全実行が同じsource idを出力した。コードの修正は不要で、失敗はなかった。変更したのはrepo/README.mdの「未実行」記述だけである。

## Findings

### 実行済み

**1. 保存後suite**

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`: **112件、失敗0、OK**（0.208 s）。
- 実行時のsource id: `5145454ab956`（以下の全bots実行のヘッダと同じ）。
- 供給済みの98／103件は今回の保存版に帰属しない。今回の112件が保存版に対する件数である。
- 内訳は未確認で、test_bots_boss.pyの件数は確認していない。

**2. 独立3・4（rooms 3,4。fps 30と60を別実行。開始3 hearts、limit 60 s）**

| bot | FPS | 部屋3 | 部屋4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| camper | 30 | 死亡 6.3 s、失hearts 3（shot 3）、攻撃0、dash0 | 死亡 6.7 s、3（shot 3）、攻撃1、dash0 |
| camper | 60 | 死亡 6.3 s、3（shot 3）、攻撃0、dash0 | 死亡 6.8 s、3（shot 3）、攻撃1、dash0 |
| walker | 30 | clear 8.9 s、失1（grub 1）、攻撃8、dash0 | clear 9.9 s、失1（grub）、攻撃7、dash0 |
| walker | 60 | clear 9.2 s、失1（grub 1）、攻撃8、dash0 | clear 9.8 s、失1（grub）、攻撃7、dash0 |
| dodger | 30 | clear 15.6 s、失0、攻撃8、dash6 | clear 18.3 s、失0、攻撃7、dash7（合計13） |
| dodger | 60 | clear 15.0 s、失0、攻撃8、dash6 | clear 17.0 s、失0、攻撃7、dash8（合計14） |

- 各行の終了時heartsと outcome は上表から導ける（camperは0／death、walkerは2／clear、dodgerは3／clear）。
- 方針とビルドの識別はsource idと出力ヘッダにある。
- dodgerのdashは各FPSで1回以上（13／14）。combat.md15の独立3・4条件は満たす。
- 新たな合計ゲートは設けていない（D-019 2）。

**3. 保持分（rooms 1-4。30と60を別実行）**

| bot | FPS | 部屋1 | 部屋2 | 部屋3 | 部屋4 | 合計 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| camper | 30 | 死亡 5.7 s、失3 | clear 10.2 s、失2 | 死亡、失3 | 死亡、失3 | clear 1/4、失11 |
| camper | 60 | 死亡、失3 | 死亡 8.9 s、失3 | 死亡、失3 | 死亡、失3 | clear 0/4、失12 |
| walker | 30 | 死亡 4.9 s、失3 | clear 8.4 s、失2 | clear、失1 | clear、失1 | clear 3/4、失7 |
| walker | 60 | 死亡 5.2 s、失3 | clear 8.4 s、失2 | clear、失1 | clear、失1 | clear 3/4、失7 |
| dodger | 30 | clear 6.6 s、失0、dash3 | clear 20.7 s、失0、dash10 | clear 15.6 s、dash6 | clear 18.3 s、dash7 | 4/4、失0、dash 26 |
| dodger | 60 | clear 9.6 s、失0、dash5 | clear 25.1 s、失0、dash14 | clear 15.0 s、dash6 | clear 17.0 s、dash8 | 4/4、失0、dash 33 |

- combat.md14（独立1〜2、各FPS別）:
  - walkerの失hearts合計は30で5、60で5（1以上）。
  - dodgerは両FPSで両部屋clear、失0（1以下）。
  - この解釈は「失hearts」。
- dodgerの1〜4 FPS比較は、clear結果が同一（4/4）で、hearts lost差は0。
- 注意: camperは部屋2のclear結果が30と60で異なる。camperには成績一致条件がない（D-019 7）ので、報告のみとする。

**dodger部屋1〜4が提出前と同じか**: **確認できていない**。パケットに提出前の数値がない。コード上は、`_dangers`と`dodger`に追加したboss用の分岐が`e.kind == "boss"`のときだけ働くため、部屋1〜4では発火しない。ただしこれは設計上の推定であり、実行による同一性の証明ではない。比較できる提出前の記録（G-001の測定値など）があればQAが照合してほしい。

**4. 新5番（rooms 5、hearts 3,2、limit 120、30と60を別実行。boss対応dodger、`log on`なし）**

| FPS | 開始hearts | 結果 | 秒数 | 失hearts | 攻撃 | dash |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 3 | clear | 21.6 s | 0 | 12 | 8 |
| 30 | 2 | clear | 21.6 s | 0 | 12 | 8 |
| 60 | 3 | clear | 32.9 s | 0 | 12 | 12 |
| 60 | 2 | clear | 32.9 s | 0 | 12 | 12 |

- FPS比較（D-019 4・5）: 3 heartsの対も2 heartsの対も、同じclear結果で、hearts lost差は0。比較条件は満たす。
- 秒数は30と60で約11 s差、dashは8対12と差がある。秒数差に閾値はなく、診断はログで行う。`log on`の判断ログは取っていない。
- 次の2点はDesignerに渡す観察である。
  - botは被弾0でボスを倒す。
  - 開始heartsが3でも2でも軌跡が同一であり、被弾が一度も起きていない。
- これは攻略可能性の証拠でもFPS差の診断でもない。診断はログが必要。B5〜B10の実接触の確認にもならない（未実施）。

**5. 通常ラン（`mode run`、limit 1200、全bot、fps 30と60を別実行、各1試行）**

| bot | FPS | 結果 | ラン時刻 | 部屋別戦闘時間（room time）・備考 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| camper | 30 | 部屋1で死亡 | 5.733 s | 失3（grub）、攻撃5 |
| camper | 60 | 部屋1で死亡 | 5.700 s | 失3（grub）、攻撃4 |
| walker | 30 | 部屋1で死亡 | 4.867 s | 失3（grub）、攻撃5 |
| walker | 60 | 部屋1で死亡 | 5.233 s | 失3（grub）、攻撃4 |
| dodger | 30 | **勝利** | **86.967 s** | 6.63 / 20.73 / 15.63 / 18.33 / 21.63 s |
| dodger | 60 | **勝利** | **103.533 s** | 9.62 / 25.07 / 15.02 / 16.97 / 32.87 s |

- dodgerの共通項目:
  - 遷移はすべて1.0 s（4回）。
  - ボス入場heartsは3。
  - 被弾0。
  - 部屋5の攻撃12回はすべてボスに命中（boss hits 12）。
  - retries 0、pause 0.0 s。
  - attempt 1。
  - driver秒とラン時刻は同じ（30で86.967 s、60で103.533 s）。
  - processing 0.02〜0.03 s（実時間であり、プレイ時間ではない）。
- 試行数は各botで1。結果は決定的なので、再実行で変わるとは期待しない。
- 独立部屋時間の合算ではなく、`RunSession`の同一試行の時計から出した値である。fixtureや状態注入は使っていない。
- camperとwalkerは部屋1で死亡して終わるため、ボスには到達しない。
- 15〜20分のVisionとの差:
  - 実測は1.5〜1.7分で、大幅に短い。
  - この測定は被弾0・retry0・待機0の理想的なbotによる下限に近い。
  - 人間のプレイは含まず、参考にはならない。
  - 時間合わせのHP増加や待機はしない（Constraints）。
  - Designerによる実測後の判断（D-019）と独立Playに渡す。

### 変更したファイル

- repo/README.md: 「実行されていない」記述を、step 40で実行済み・source id・結果の所在に更新した。
- コードとテストは変更していない（失敗がなかったため）。BUILDは0.6-g002-public-32のまま。

### 未実施

- V1補完（legacy route表示、弾ID・消滅理由、長時間の観測蓄積）。
- 契約試験の細目: B3毎frame軌道、B6／B7実dash接触、B9接触無害、B10帯内外、T1〜T4・C2・C3のボス絡み、共有回帰の細目。
- pause・retryを含む通常ラン計測（run_driverのcontrol構文経由）。botsのplay_runは両方を行わない。
- ボス部屋の`log on`による判断ログ診断（差が約11 sあるため、必要なら取る）。
- V2（実機入力）はD-021により対象外。
- 現行の他のrun経路（`play.py --view trace`）の実行は、このStepでは行っていない。

## Decisions already made

- D-017：二攻撃、境界回復、死亡優先、先頭retry、時計・表示契約。
- D-019：旧集計の適用終了、共有回帰、対応bot比較、実測後Designer判断。
- D-021：現状repoとStudio内テキスト検証でBuildを進める。

## Constraints

第1〜4部屋、共有戦闘ルール、既存botの独立1〜4方針を保持する。新戦闘入力、checkpoint、時間合わせのHP増加・待機、購入・外部委託は加えていない。独立部屋の時間合算を通常ラン到達の証拠にしない。完成前に独立QAへ送らない。

## Open questions

- 仕様の不足・矛盾: なし。Designerへの質問はない。
- Studioへ（ルーティング判断）:
  1. 未実施の契約試験・V1補完を、独立QAへ送る前に別のGameplay Engineer Stepで完了させるか。全て完了とは言えないので、このハンドオフは完成資料ではなく部分成果として扱うのが妥当。
  2. 新5番のbot成績（被弾0、両FPSで同一clear、時間約22 s／33 s）と通常ランの総時間（約1.5〜1.7分）をDesignerの実測後判断へ回すこと。その際、botが被弾0であり、ボスの攻撃が実際に回避された根拠はB5〜B10の接触試験で別途確認する必要がある点を添える。
  3. dodger部屋1〜4が提出前と同じかについて、比較できる提出前の記録の有無。

## Expected output

Studioは次を行う。

- 上記の判断に従い、未実施の契約試験・V1補完・retry/pause計測を別のGameplay Engineer Stepとしてルーティングする。または、QAが追加試験を行う前提で独立QAへ送る。
- Designerの実測後判断（新5番、通常ラン時間）をReview前にルーティングする。
- 完成資料はまだない（部分成果）。

## Sender assessment

- 38の変更はそのまま通った。112件OK、全botの実行も例外なく完了し、保存版の構文リスクは解消した。
- 未実行リスクのうち、部屋1〜4への漏れは、コード上は発火しない構造で、結果も不自然ではない。ただし提出前との数値比較はできていない。
- dodgerがボス戦で被弾0なのは、方針が「警告中は線外で停止、線上なら即dash／step」と保守的だからだと考える。ただしログを見ていないので推測である。
- 30と60で秒数・dash数が違う理由（約11 s、8対12）は未診断。
- 2 heartsと3 heartsで軌跡が同じなのは、被弾が一度もないため当然である。ボス戦の死亡リスクは、このbotでは測れていない。
- 確信度: suiteとbots出力の事実としての正確さは高い。難度・体験・FPS差の原因については結論を持たない。

# 53: studio → gameplay-engineer — Complete D-022 observation and final validation

## Task

Complete the remaining D-022 observation implementation, acceptance coverage, and documentation. Execute the full suite against the completed saved sources and record their source id; return the Build report to Studio before Split C.

## Context

52 delivered partial implementation. Its runtime Build check ran `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` successfully: 140 tests, exit 0. This verifies that saved intermediate build only; remaining D-022 work is not complete.

50 and 52 are two consecutive partial returns for this continuation. Continue with the same Role because no input or design question remains. If the same work returns partial a third time, Studio will route to Technical Director for splitting or replanning.

## Findings

52 delivered:
- One leading note for legacy room 5 player output.
- Opt-in shot IDs, firing events, and removal events.
- Shot numbering carried across room entry and reset on retry.
- Diagnostic shot tracking and active-shot trace metadata.
- Controlled shot and note probes, plus related manual documentation.

Remaining work:
1. Implement parser dispatch and validation for `view-every` and numeric `trace-every`.
2. Implement bounded periodic output while preserving event output, simulation behavior, and default output.
3. Reset observation scheduling on retry as specified.
4. Implement one final summary covering every attempt and the D-022 fields: outcomes, clocks, room times, boss entry hearts, hits, attacks, pauses, driver elapsed time excluding pauses, and processing time.
5. Complete L1 output/result equivalence coverage, public spitter/boss shared-sequence coverage, and O1–O6 coverage, including controlled 1200-second executions separately at 30 and 60 FPS.
6. Update interval and summary documentation and stale integration-gap descriptions.
7. Execute and inspect the full suite, including `tests/test_play_run_controls.py`, against the completed saved sources and record their source id.

Use the approved spec and D-022 for exact behavior. Historical unpersisted proposals described in 52 are not the current baseline.

## Decisions already made

- D-017: boss combat, continuous run, clocks, terminal priority, retry, and presentation contract.
- D-019: retained regressions and subsequent measurement and Designer judgment.
- D-021: current text build and Studio verification authorized; no real-device supply or verification requirement for this Goal.
- D-022: supplement behavior is settled; no pending design clarification.

## Constraints

Preserve rooms 1–4, shared combat rules, and legacy behavior except the approved note. Preserve existing tests. Exercise acceptance cases independently at 30 and 60 FPS.

Do not start Split C until this implementation is complete and its full suite is green. Split C remains a later Build step for pause/retry normal-run measurement and dodger rooms 1–4 regression fixation. Independent QA follows the completed Build work.

No purchases, outsourcing, or additional expenditure. Do not change approved scope or resolve new spec ambiguities through implementation.

## Open questions

None currently. If a new spec ambiguity or unworkable plan is discovered, identify it precisely and hand back under the Role contract.

## Expected output

Return a handoff addressed to `studio` with:
- Delivered files and completed acceptance cases.
- Documentation updates.
- Actual full-suite command, result, and final executed source id.
- Separate 30/60 FPS long-observation execution evidence.
- Any remaining work or concrete blocker.

Distinguish automated Build evidence from independent verification. Do not claim completion based solely on the intermediate 140-test result. Studio will route Split C after completion, then independent QA.

# D-019: G-002新構成における旧集計の適用終了と代替評価

## Decision

D-018の方向に基づき、D-006、正本step44、combat.mdの関連基準の適用を次のとおり変更する。本DecisionはG-002の新第5部屋と連続ランに限定した適用変更であり、D-006本文、過去G-001の判断・結果、旧構成に対する基準は変更しない。

1. 新構成には、step44基準13a〜dのwalker独立3〜5合計3〜7 hearts・2/3 clear、dodgerのwalker比1/2以下・3/3 clear、camperのwalker未満clearを適用しない。13eの旧集計に関するFPS別判定と、13fの過去実測値も新構成の合否根拠にしない。旧集計の逸脱に関する再判断条件は新構成へ移植しない。
2. 第1〜4部屋の構成、共有戦闘ルール、独立部屋の3 hearts開始を保持する。combat.md14の独立1〜2比較は30/60 FPSそれぞれで保持する。独立3・4はwalker／dodger／camperの部屋別・FPS別成績を報告し、新たな合計下限・上限・clear数・bot間比率を旧値から算出しない。
3. combat.md15は独立3・4で保持する。各FPSでdodgerのdash1回以上を確認し、0回ならDesignerへ報告する既存規則も保持する。使用を強制するためcapやgapを変更しない。新5番は使用回数条件を終了し、仕様B6の実接触による無傷・攻撃消費・終了後の追加被害なしを、突進と短射それぞれ、両FPSで検証する。B5の横移動も保持し、dash必須戦にはしない。
4. combat.md16cと対応BotsTestの独立1〜4のdodger比較は保持する。新5番にも「同じclear結果、hearts lost差1以下」を採択する。ただし下記の対応条件を満たすボス対応dodgerによる独立試験に限る。これはFPS比較であり、ボスの難度や到達可能性の合格基準ではない。
5. 新5番比較は、同一ビルド・同一bot方針・同一初期状態・同一ゲーム時間limitを使う。独立標準開始は3 heartsとし、連続ランで生じる2 hearts開始も別対として試験する。開始heartsを混ぜて比較しない。両FPSで終了理由をclear／death／unfinishedとして区別し、一方のみunfinishedの場合は比較を未完了として再調査する。両方unfinishedでも攻略の証拠にはならない。
6. ボス対応dodgerはplayer viewで読めるB、攻撃名、予兆の固定方向・範囲、回復、実弾を根拠に行動する。未表示の将来状態を使わず、非致死スワイプによる中断を前提にせず、回避後の反撃へ戻る。反応間隔0.15秒と方針を両FPSで共通にする。対応確認前の数値は診断資料に留め、比較をpassにしない。独立1〜4の既存方針は保持し、変更が必要なら影響と回帰を明示する。
7. FPS比較の不一致はログと制御入力で原因を分ける。帯内接触だけによる命中差にはD-017の許容を適用するが、bot比較の閾値を自動的に緩和しない。閾値超過はDesignerへ戻す。帯外の同条件差、フェーズ・表示・時間の不一致はQAが規則違反として扱う。walker／camperに新たな成績一致条件は設けず、bot時刻感度を共有規則の違反の免責にしない。
8. 旧第5部屋fixtureは必須にしない。残す場合は共有回帰専用と明示する。新評価は仕様B1〜B10・V1、通常ランR1〜R5・T1〜T4・C1〜C3・V2、独立Play、同一試行の連続ラン時間計測へ接続する。

追加の難度数値ゲートの要否は、対応botの両FPS成績とログ、独立QA、独立Play、連続到達・終端・時間の実測後にDesignerが判断する。StudioはReview前にその再判断を必ずルーティングする。追加不要の場合も理由を記録し、未判断のままGoal達成へ進めない。詳細は仕様§8による。

## Rationale

旧基準は旧第5部屋を含む独立3部屋と各3 hearts開始に依存する。単体ボスと回復付き連続ランでは、集計の母集団と開始条件が変わり、旧数値から難度を推定できない。

dashの価値は実接触に対する有効性と独立Playで評価できる。使用回数を強制すると、有効な横移動を不当に罰する。

ボス対応dodgerの数値比較はFPSによる大きな挙動差を検出する補助ゲートとして採る。両FPSで死亡する同一結果も通り得るため、攻略可能性や体験の代用にはしない。

## Alternatives considered

- 旧集計を新5番または連続ランへ継承する：開始条件と敵構成が異なるため不採択。
- 独立3・4へ比例配分した新数値を置く：実測上の根拠がないため不採択。
- 新5番でもdash1回以上を強制する：対処の有効性と使用頻度を混同するため不採択。
- ボスのFPS比較を設けない：共有規則試験だけでは対応botの戦闘全体の差を見落とすため不採択。
- 旧fixtureを必須維持する：新構成の難度証拠にならず、必須成果にはしない。

## Revisit when

対応botのFPS比較が閾値を超える、対処が有効でも反撃へ戻れない、道中で到達が妨げられる、回復やretryが学習を妨げる場合。

追加数値ゲートの判断に必要な実測が揃った場合。15〜20分との不整合を承認範囲内で解消できない場合、または承認を超える費用・リスクが判明した場合は、StudioからGame Directorへ戻す。

本Decisionは適用整理の完了を示す。実行成功、指定sha一致、難度、体験、所要時間の検証済みを示さない。

# D-021: テキストビルドとStudio内検証でBuildへ進む

## Decision

Ownerは22の案Aを選択し、供給・検証・予算の回答権限者をすべてOwnerとした。実機ホスト・実gamepad・外部配員を今回の開始条件から除き、既存のテキスト表示とスクリプト実行によるBuildを承認した。

Ownerの回答全文：

> 案A。回答の権限者はすべて Owner（私）で、ここで回答します。(1) 実行経路: project.md の build: と run_tests / run_play / run_trace / run_bots がそのまま実行経路です。gameplay-engineer と qa は Step の中で @run を使い、サンドボックスでテスト・プレイ・トレース・ボットを実行できます（G-001 と同じ）。基線は repo/ の現状で、指定 sha の確認は不要です。project.md の「build 0.4」は古い記述で、repo/ が正です。(2) 実機・gamepad・デスクトップの表示環境はなく、用意もしません。Constraints の「Desktop, keyboard and gamepad」は製品の対象環境で、今回の検証環境の要求ではありません。検証は G-001 と同じく、テキスト表示のビルドとスクリプト実行で行います。(3) 独立した QA と Play は、Studio の qa と playtester の Step が担います。外部の配員はありません。(4) 費用: 購入・外部委託・追加の金銭は一切ありません。予算は Studio の通常の Step の範囲で、人日の見積もりは不要です。以上で D-020 の条件は満たされたものとして、Build へ進んでください。

実行基線は作業開始時のrepo/とし、指定shaとの照合は要求しない。project.mdのbuild 0.4表記は基線の根拠にしない。購入・外部委託・追加金銭支出は認めない。人日見積もりや外部検証枠の取得を開始条件にしない。

D-020に代わる開始条件として本Decisionを適用する。D-020に由来する実機ホスト、実gamepad、外部配員、費用見積もり取得の要求は後続計画より本Decisionを優先する。D-015〜D-019のゲーム体験、共有戦闘回帰、30/60 FPS、実測後Designer判断は維持する。独立QA・限定Art Verify・独立PlayはStudio内の別Stepで行う。

これはOwnerによる開始許可と検証範囲の変更であり、実行成功、受け入れ基準合格、体験Goal達成の証拠ではない。

## Rationale

Owner自身から不足していた供給・実行経路・予算方針への回答があり、今回の検証をG-001と同じテキストビルド方式に限定した。Studioが同じ供給確認を繰り返す必要はなく、既存仕様・計画に基づくBuildへ進める。

## Alternatives considered

- 実機ホストと実gamepadを用意する：Ownerが用意しないと明示したため採らない。
- 見積もり・調達条件を取得する案B：追加金銭を使わず通常Step内で進めるため採らない。
- 条件整備まで停止する案C：OwnerがBuild開始を明示したため採らない。

## Revisit when

通常のStudio Stepでは実行できない具体的な障害、追加支出の必要性、またはテキスト方式では仕様の意味を定められない矛盾が判明したとき。製品の実機対応を検証する別のGoalを開始するとき。

# G-002 最終ボスと連続ラン仕様

Status: Designと基準適用整理を確定。§11でV1補足3件（旧経路のボス表示、弾ID・消滅理由、長時間観測）を確定（D-022）。未実装・未検証。詳細契約はD-017、D-018に基づく旧基準の適用変更はD-019に記録する。

本書は新しい連続ラン、第5部屋、ラン境界・終端についての追加仕様。第1〜4部屋の構成、部屋内の既存敵・プレイヤー戦闘規則は既存仕様が正本である。G-002新構成への基準適用はD-019と本書§8が正本。過去G-001の判断・結果と既存Decision本文は変更しない。

## 1. 体験意図

道中で覚えた固定照準と回避を使い、ボスの次の攻撃を見て、避けた後にも攻撃できる場所を選ぶ。遠くへ逃げる安全と、近くに残って反撃する利益を区別し、通常敵との混戦とは異なる一対一の山場を作る。

## 2. ランと入場

通常ランは第1部屋から始まり、1→2→3→4→5の順に進む。第5部屋はボス1体のみ。通常敵、増援、第6部屋、ボス用チェックポイントはない。

各戦闘フレームの勝敗解決後、生存して全敵撃破なら第1〜4部屋は部屋クリアとなる。クリア表示を1.0秒間出してから次部屋へ自動遷移する。この間に戦闘は進まず、操作も受け付けない。次部屋の開始表示を出した後、次の戦闘フレームから動く。第5部屋の全敵撃破は部屋遷移を起こさず最終勝利となる。

通常ランの初期状態は第1部屋、3/3 hearts、位置(8,4)、右向き、停止。敵は各部屋の正規初期配置から始まる。

### 境界での継承

| 状態 | 第1〜4部屋クリア後の処理 |
|---|---|
| hearts | 生存者に1 heart回復、上限3。0から回復しない |
| 回復の時点 | 次部屋入場時に1回だけ。クリア表示中の再適用なし |
| 位置・向き | (8,4)、右向きへ戻す |
| 移動・ダッシュ | 停止。ダッシュ中なら終了させる |
| 攻撃回復、ダッシュ待ち時間 | 0へ戻す |
| hit-stun、被弾保護 | 0へ戻す |
| 予約攻撃 | 破棄 |
| 敵、予兆、弾、攻撃の接触消費状態 | 旧部屋分を破棄し、次部屋を新規開始 |
| 保持入力 | 破棄。実機入力では離して再入力するまで再発火させない |
| 反応ルールの定義・順序 | 同じラン内で継承 |
| 反応ルールの最終実行時刻、直前の盤面・メッセージ記憶 | 入場時に初期化。新部屋の表示から判断する |
| 未来の時刻指定入力 | ラン時刻に従い保持。境界中に期限が来た戦闘入力は破棄し、後からまとめて実行しない |

3 heartsでクリアすれば3、2なら3、1なら2で次へ進む。第4部屋も同じ扱いなのでボスには2または3 heartsで入る。消耗を完全には消さず、最低2回の被弾余地を確保する。部屋内回復、回復アイテム、任意回復は追加しない。

「3 hearts per room」は独立部屋試験の開始条件として保持する。通常ランの継承は本書の新契約であり、既存部屋内ルールの変更ではない。

## 3. ボス「洞窟の番人」

盤面印は`B`。初期位置(12,4)、HP12。プレイヤーへの接触そのものではダメージを与えず、攻撃の有効期間だけ危害がある。全フェーズで既存の正面スワイプが届けば1ダメージを受ける。装甲、無敵フェーズ、HPによる加速・形態変化はない。

攻撃は「突進」「短射」の2種類。順序は突進→短射→突進…で固定し、HPや距離で飛ばさない。初回入場時は突進を準備する。

各攻撃の前は接近状態となり、速度1.0 tile/sでプレイヤーへ歩く。距離2.0 tiles以下になったフレームで停止し、その攻撃の予兆を始める。予兆以降、回復終了まで追尾・再照準しない。回復終了後に次の攻撃の接近へ移る。距離0での照準は右(+x)に固定する。

### 攻撃定義

| 項目 | 突進 | 短射 |
|---|---|---|
| 予兆 | 0.7秒 | 0.8秒 |
| 照準 | 予兆開始時のプレイヤー位置への単位方向に固定 | 同左 |
| 予兆中の移動 | なし | なし |
| 発動 | 8.0 tiles/sで0.3秒、最大2.4 tiles移動 | 固定方向へ弾1個を発射 |
| 危険範囲 | 移動中のボス中心から半径0.6 tile | 弾中心から半径0.4 tile |
| 弾 | なし | 3.0 tiles/s、寿命1.0秒、最大移動3.0 tiles |
| ダメージ | 1 heart、1突進につき最大1回 | 1 heart、1弾につき最大1回 |
| 有効期間後 | 1.2秒の回復 | 発射から1.0秒の有効期間後、1.4秒の回復 |
| 回復中 | 停止、無害、スワイプ可能 | 同左。回復開始時には当該弾が存在しない |

短射は弾が早く消費されても発射から1.0秒待って回復へ入る。命中・吸収によって次の予兆が早まらない。寿命到達フレームは弾を失効させ、その弾の接触を新たに判定しない。

突進は部屋端でクランプするが、壁到達や接触によって有効期間・回復開始を早めない。通常命中、保護中接触とも突進の一撃を消費し、移動自体は継続する。

短射の弾は部屋端、寿命、最初の接触で消える。短射の有効期間にボス本体からの接触ダメージはない。ボスの弾は同時に最大1個であり、スピッターのcap／cue gap調停には参加しない。

### 中断と反撃

非致死スワイプはどのフェーズも中断・遅延・延長しない。HPは通常どおり減る。予兆中には`the boss takes the swipe; the warning continues`を出す。致死スワイプなら直ちに予兆と攻撃主体を失効させ、フレーム末の勝敗解決へ進む。

回復中は接触しても無害で、プレイヤーの攻撃回復0.35秒は変更しない。回復開始から届く位置にいれば、突進回復では時刻0、0.35、0.70、1.05秒の4回、短射回復では少なくとも同じ4回の攻撃開始が可能。これは理論上の機会数で、実測の撃破時間ではない。

突進には横移動またはダッシュ、短射には射線からの横移動、ダッシュ吸収、射程外への退避が使える。後退だけで避けた場合は回復中に距離を戻す必要がある。横へ避けて近くに残れば反撃しやすい。2種類とも予兆中の連打で止められない。

### 共有戦闘との関係

攻撃1ダメージ、射程1.5 tiles、回復0.35秒、ダッシュ4 tiles／0.25秒・待ち時間0.6秒、ダッシュ中の予約攻撃、被弾stun0.3秒・被弾後0.8秒までの保護は保持する。

D-005の結果規則をボスにも明示適用する。保護中の弾接触は弾消費、保護中の突進接触はその突進の一撃消費。保護終了後に持ち越しダメージを起こさない。

接触は移動後のフレームごとの距離判定、`distance <= reach`とする。本仕様は、既存と同じ速度・接触半径の突進と弾に限り、D-002／D-003と同じ帯を明示採択する。

- 弾：横ずれ0.39以下は命中、0.40超は非命中。
- 突進：横ずれ0.57以下は命中、0.60超は非命中。
- その間は上端を含み、30/60 FPSで命中差を許容する。
- 許容は命中／消費の有無だけ。照準、フェーズ、表示、時間の違いを免責しない。
- 新形状・別速度への包括的な拡張ではない。帯外差または突進帯0.03 tile超の所見はDesignerへ戻す。

## 4. フレーム内勝敗と終端

同一戦闘フレームでは、受理済みのプレイヤー行動と、まだ有効な危害による結果を解決した後、次の優先順位で終端を一度だけ決定する。

1. heartsが0なら死亡。
2. 生存して第5部屋のボスHPが0なら最終勝利。
3. 生存して第1〜4部屋の全敵HPが0なら部屋クリア。
4. それ以外は戦闘継続。

同一フレームに致死スワイプと既発射弾による致死被弾が成立した場合は死亡。スワイプで攻撃主体を倒したなら、その主体から新しい突進接触や発射は生じない。既発射弾はフレーム末の結果確定までは独立した危害として扱う。

部屋クリア・最終勝利・死亡の確定時に、残弾と予兆を全消去する。以後の表示時間中にダメージ、移動、予約攻撃、回復待ち時間、敵行動を進めない。死亡したまま次部屋へ進まず、勝利後の残弾死もない。確定後の勝敗変更と重複イベントは禁止する。

### 再挑戦

最終勝利・死亡の画面で`retry`を受け付ける。戦闘中と部屋クリア表示中のretryは無効。retryは終端メニュー操作であり、新しい戦闘入力ではない。

再挑戦は第1部屋、3 hearts、通常ラン初期状態へ戻る。ボスHP・順序、敵、弾、タイマー、予約・保持入力、勝敗、両ゲーム時刻、反応記憶を初期化する。FPSと反応ルール定義は同じセッション設定として保持する。旧試行の未来の時刻入力は破棄し、再挑戦の入力列を新試行用として明示して渡す。旧時刻入力を自動再生しない。

同一プロセス内のretryと、通常ランを新規起動した場合の初期戦闘状態は一致する。独立第5部屋試験の再実行は診断経路に留まり、通常ランのチェックポイントとして表示しない。

## 5. 時刻、入力、ポーズ、実行上限

- 部屋時刻は入場時0。戦闘中だけ進む。
- ラン時刻は第1部屋開始時0。戦闘と1.0秒の部屋間表示中に進む。ポーズ・死亡・勝利画面中は停止する。
- 各イベントは試行番号、部屋番号、ラン時刻、部屋時刻を区別して観測できること。
- 通常ランの時刻指定戦闘入力はラン時刻基準。独立部屋試験は部屋時刻基準。モードを冒頭に表示し、同じ入力列の基準を途中で変えない。
- 同じ時刻の入力は記載順。時刻入力を処理してから反応ルールを上から評価する。反応は既存のルールごとの0.15秒制限を保持する。
- 入場時刻と一致する時刻入力は、入場初期化と開始表示の後に受理する。クリア確定フレームでまだ受理していない戦闘入力を次部屋へ持ち越さない。
- ポーズは戦闘・部屋間表示を凍結する。時刻、フェーズ、弾、ダッシュ、保護、入力待ち時間、反応評価も進めない。
- ポーズ突入時に保持移動を解除する。予約済み攻撃は凍結して保持し、再開後のダッシュ終了時に通常どおり実行する。ポーズ中の戦闘入力は破棄する。
- 再開はゲーム時刻に依存しない制御操作で可能とする。スクリプト経路にも有限時間で再開を検証する手段が必要。具体構文はPlanで定め、停止したゲーム時刻にresumeを予約するだけの方式にはしない。
- 検証実行のlimit到達は`time limit — run unfinished`。勝利・死亡・部屋クリアと異なる終了理由とし、limitそのものを敗北にしない。
- limitと戦闘結果が同じ最終フレームなら、そのフレームの死亡／勝利／クリアを先に解決し、実行停止理由も別に記録する。

現行のpause、retry、連続モード、実機入力層、長時間player／trace経路は存在すると仮定しない。上記は新設要求である。Desktopキーボード／ゲームパッドの同等操作を要求として保持し、実装・検証経路と費用をPlanへ渡す。

## 6. player viewの情報契約

数値座標を内部確認専用にせず、テキストだけで危険を識別できること。

常設表示：

- `run — room n/5 — hearts h/3`と両ゲーム時刻。
- ボス部屋では`boss B — HP n/12 — <approach|warning|active|recovery>`。
- 次攻撃名は、その攻撃の接近開始時から`next: charge`または`next: short shot`として表示する。
- 既存のプレイヤー、敵、弾の印は保持し、ボスだけ`B`を追加する。

予兆開始時に即時描画し、全予兆中に`cue: B <charge|short shot> — locked <direction> — <seconds> left`を出す。

- 突進：固定した2.4-tile経路を`~`で示し、`danger: charge lane, radius 0.6 tile, rounded ends`を併記する。
- 短射：固定した3.0-tile射程を`~`で示し、`danger: one shot, contact radius 0.4 tile, range 3.0 tiles`を併記する。
- 文字セルの線は正確な連続座標の境界そのものではないことをmanualで説明する。方向と射程・接触幅の数値を省略しない。
- 発動で予兆線を外し、短射の実弾を`*`で描く。敵印と重なって隠れる弾も、活動中の弾数を表示して存在が消えたように見せない。

メッセージ：

| 契機 | 文字列 |
|---|---|
| 突進予兆 | `the boss prepares a charge` |
| 短射予兆 | `the boss aims a short shot` |
| 発動 | `the boss charges` / `the boss fires a short shot` |
| 回復開始 | `the boss is recovering — safe to approach and swipe` |
| 回復中 | `recovery: <seconds> left` |
| 回復終了 | `the boss resumes pursuit` |
| 突進被弾 | `YOU ARE HIT by the boss's charge`＋既存hearts suffix |
| 短射被弾 | 既存`YOU ARE HIT by a shot from the <direction>`＋suffix |
| 部屋クリア | `room n cleared — next room n+1` |
| 入場回復 | `recovered 1 heart`または`hearts already full` |
| 最終勝利 | `run won — boss defeated — retry: start from room 1` |
| 死亡 | `you went down — run lost — retry: start from room 1` |
| 再挑戦 | `new attempt — room 1/5` |

半秒ごとの定期表示に加え、予兆、発動、回復開始・終了、HP変化、被弾、部屋クリア、入場、勝敗、retry、pause／resumeで即時描画する。同時刻の複数変化は順序を保って1画面へまとめてよいが、メッセージを欠落させない。

既存敵の`rears back`、`takes aim`、`YOU ARE HIT by`のprefixとstep94の文言・方向規則を保持する。ボス予兆は既存敵の文字列に偽装しない。ボス対応の反応ルール／botsは、プレイヤーに見えるボス印・状態・攻撃名を根拠に追加する。

Art Directorによる限定Verifyを推奨する。対象はテキストの2攻撃の区別、予兆と実弾の区別、回復と次攻撃、重なり、勝敗・retryの識別。成果はplayer viewの具体的な読みにくさと文言・表示配置の修正案。グラフィカル素材制作や戦闘ルール決定は依頼しない。

## 7. 独立QAの受け入れ基準

以下を30 FPSと60 FPSで別々に判定する。時間許容は各実行の1フレーム以内、位置は仕様上の値とそのフレームの移動量を照合する。接触帯以外の結果差を、時間許容だけで免責しない。

player表示と同一ビルドの状態観測を対照する。試験用状態設定は独立した境界再現に使ってよいが、通常ランの連続到達の証拠にはしない。

| ID | 条件と合格条件 | 必要な観測 |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | 新規通常ランで1→2→3→4→5へ生存到達。各正規敵を実際に倒し、第5部屋はB1体だけ | 入場・撃破・クリア列、状態とplayer表示 |
| R2 | 第1〜4部屋の構成・配置・既存パラメータが元仕様と一致 | 部屋データと回帰試験 |
| R3 | 境界直前hearts1/2/3から次入場2/3/3。0なら死亡し遷移しない | 境界前後のhearts、回復イベント |
| R4 | ダッシュ、保護、予約攻撃、弾、保持移動、反応記憶を残した境界で、§2の各リセットが成立 | 境界前後全状態、次部屋最初の行動 |
| R5 | 部屋クリアから1.0秒後に次入場。表示中の戦闘入力は持ち越されず、入場同時刻入力は新部屋へ1回だけ適用 | 両時刻、入力処理列 |
| B1 | Bは(12,4)、HP12、攻撃順が突進→短射で反復。HP6以下でも変わらない | 初期状態、少なくとも各3回の予兆 |
| B2 | 予兆の途中にプレイヤーが移動しても照準不変。距離0では右。発動まで突進0.7秒／短射0.8秒 | cueと方向、発動時刻 |
| B3 | 開けた位置で突進2.4 tiles／0.3秒。壁ではクランプし、回復開始時刻は変化しない | 毎フレーム位置・フェーズ |
| B4 | 短射は1弾、速度3.0、寿命1.0秒。未接触・通常命中・吸収の各場合で回復開始は発射1.0秒後 | 発射、弾消滅理由、回復開始 |
| B5 | 開けた位置で、予兆開始から0.4秒以内に射線と直交して1 tile移動を完了すると各攻撃を無傷で避ける | 操作列、固定方向、hearts |
| B6 | 各攻撃へのダッシュ接触で無傷。ダッシュ終了後も同じ攻撃からダメージなし | 接触時の保護、消費、以後のhurt |
| B7 | 被弾保護が攻撃途中で切れる設定でも、既に接触した突進／弾から追加ダメージなし。次攻撃は通常命中 | 消費状態と各hurt |
| B8 | 非致死スワイプは全フェーズでHPだけ1減り、時刻・照準・状態不変。予兆中は継続文言。致死なら新発動なし | スワイプ前後状態と表示 |
| B9 | 回復中に接触しても無傷。開始から射程内・正面なら少なくとも4回の攻撃が成立。回復時間1.2／1.4秒 | 攻撃・HP・フェーズ時刻 |
| B10 | 接触帯の内側・外側・上端を各攻撃で確認。帯外は両FPSで同じ結果、帯内だけ許容差 | 実軌道の横ずれと接触距離 |
| T1 | 最後の敵撃破後に残弾を残す。クリア確定後は弾消去、追撃死なし、操作拒否 | 終端前後とその後2秒の状態 |
| T2 | ボス致死スワイプと既発射弾の致死接触を同フレームで成立させると死亡のみ。生存なら勝利のみ | 同フレーム結果、終端イベント数 |
| T3 | 勝利／死亡後に2秒分stepと戦闘入力を与えても戦闘状態・ゲーム時刻不変 | 終端状態比較 |
| T4 | 勝利と死亡の各々からretryし、初期状態が新規通常ランと一致。旧未来入力・予約攻撃・メッセージは再発しない | 試行番号、初期状態、入力列 |
| C1 | 部屋時刻は毎入場0、ラン時刻は連続。境界1秒はランだけ進む | 両時刻の列 |
| C2 | 予兆・ダッシュ・保護・部屋間表示の各途中でpause。外部経過2秒を挟んでも各残時間不変、再開後に通常継続 | pause前後とresume後状態 |
| C3 | 戦闘中のlimit到達はunfinishedで勝敗なし。勝利／死亡同フレームではその結果が記録される | 終了理由と勝敗の別字段 |
| V1 | §6の各表示がplayer viewだけで読め、変化フレームに出る。短射の予兆と実弾、回復終了を取り違える文字列なし | player出力と状態の照合 |
| V2 | キーボード／ゲームパッドで移動・攻撃・ダッシュ・pause・終端retryが同じ状態遷移を生む | 実機経路の同等操作記録 |

V2をheadless scriptのみで合格にしない。実機入力経路が未実装なら未検証／依存として明記する。

共有回帰はcombat.md基準1〜11、17〜21、step68のvariant文字列・runner kill解釈、step72 R3-1〜R3-10、step94 W1〜W8を対象にする。第5部屋固有部分と既存の既知ギャップは§8に従う。既存テストのgreenだけで新しい連続ランを合格にしない。

## 8. 旧基準とDecisionの対応

D-019で以下を確定する。「保持」は該当する独立部屋／共有挙動で保持する意味であり、通常ランのhearts合計へ置き換えない。「適用終了」はG-002新構成に限る。旧Decision本文と過去G-001の判断・結果は保存する。

| 出典・対象 | 扱い | 置換先・理由 |
|---|---|---|
| combat.md Rooms、12、test_rooms_match_the_spec | 第1〜4部屋保持、第5部屋置換 | 旧5番ブルート位置のassertをB(12,4)、HP12、1体の確認へ置換。R2／B1。単体ボスへの構成変更による |
| step72 R3-1の「rooms 1,2,4,5 unchanged」 | 第5部屋だけ適用終了 | 新5番はB1。他のR3-1〜R3-10と第1〜4部屋は保持 |
| combat.md1〜10、19〜21、D-001／D-004／D-005 | 保持 | 既存敵・プレイヤーの共有回帰。ボスの明示適用は§3、B5〜B9 |
| combat.md11／18、step46、CueGapTest | 第4部屋と共有試験保持、旧5番依存を置換 | 4番の初射・実部屋gap・強制同時射撃・cap遅延等を保持。5番の旧spitter試験はB2／B4へ。ボスはspitter gap調停に参加しない |
| D-002／D-003、combat.md17／16e | 保持＋ボスへ明示適用 | §3／B10。帯内の命中差だけを許容し、時刻・表示・フェーズは免責しない |
| D-006、step44の13a／13b | 新構成への適用終了 | walker独立3〜5合計3〜7 hearts、2/3 clear、構造上限7を新ボス・連続ランへ移さない。独立3・4の部屋別報告、ボス対処試験、独立Playへ接続 |
| step44の13c | 新構成への適用終了 | dodgerのwalker比1/2以下・3/3 clearを終了。母集団変更のため。新しい比率・clear数は未設定 |
| step44の13d | 新構成への適用終了 | camperのclear数がwalker未満という旧比較を終了。独立3・4の両者成績は引き続き報告 |
| step44の13e／13f、Reporting rule、Revisit、What QA re-verifies | 旧集計部分の適用終了 | 旧FPS別集計、旧逸脱報告・再計測手順、過去実測値を新構成のゲートにしない。両FPS別の新報告と下記再判断へ。過去記録は保持 |
| combat.md14、step44の14保持注記 | 保持 | 独立1〜2、各FPS別にwalker合計1以上、dodger合計1以下・両方clear。walkerのclear義務なし。brute対応方針も保持 |
| combat.md15、step44の15保持注記 | 独立3・4保持、5番置換 | 3・4は各FPSでdodger dash1回以上。0ならDesigner報告、使用を強制する変更はしない。5番は両攻撃の実接触を伴うB6で有効性を確認。B5と独立Playも保持 |
| combat.md16a／16b | 適用対象を更新 | 保持した共有基準と14／15を両FPSで確認。終了した13の旧集計を16b経由で復活させない。新仕様§7も両FPSで確認 |
| combat.md16c、BotsTest.test_dodger_agrees_at_30_and_60_fps | 独立1〜4保持、5番置換 | 新5番はボス対応dodgerで同じclear結果・hearts lost差1以下を採択。下記条件を必須とし、難度評価の代用にしない |
| combat.md16d／16e | 保持 | walker成績の一致は要求しない。bot時刻感度と規則違反を区別し、共有ルールの差は免責しない |
| BotsTest.test_walker_meets_criteria_13_and_14_at_each_rate | 一部保持・置換 | 旧13のwalker下限・clear数・dodger比率と3/3・camper比較を新構成から外す。14の1〜2 assert、15の3・4確認を保持。独立3・4報告と新5番比較・対処試験を追加する |
| その他BotsTest | 保持＋対応確認 | bot終了、ログ有無の結果一致、ログ観測、walker比較距離、brute wind-upへswipeしない試験を保持。新ボス対応とログの観測範囲を確認 |
| D-007、step46、SpitterTestのroom3 | 保持 | 一般上限は最大5。静止12秒最大3の試験だけでcap遅延の一般境界を合格にしない。player印＋直近spitによる観測法も保持 |
| step59→step68／D-011 | 保持 | step68が正本。runner通常HPはcancelではなくkill。variant文字列も保持 |
| step94、D-013／D-014 | 保持、一部経路置換 | 既存文字列・方向・prefixとW1〜W8を保持。W2の旧5番実spitter経路は4番とpracticeへ、新5番はボス短射の表示確認へ |
| D-013／D-014のG-001既知ギャップ・合格判断 | 保持 | 過去判断を変更せず、新機能への検証免除に拡張しない |
| 旧終端記述、manual、04の静的所見 | 新契約へ接続 | §4、T1〜T4。現行実装が満たすとの証拠ではない |

旧第5部屋fixtureの維持は必須ではない。使用するなら旧構成と明示した共有回帰に限り、新5番・連続ランの難度や合格を示すものにしない。テストの削除だけで完了とせず、上表の保持部分と置換先を追跡可能にする。具体的な試験構造はPlanに残す。

### ボスのFPS比較条件

同一ビルド、同一方針のボス対応dodger、同一初期位置・向き・戦闘状態、同一ゲーム時間limitで独立5番を30/60 FPS比較する。3 hearts開始と、連続ランで可能な2 hearts開始を別々に比較し、各対で同じclear結果・hearts lost差1以下を要求する。

対応botはplayer viewのB、攻撃名、固定方向・危険範囲、予兆、回復、実弾に基づき、反応間隔0.15秒で回避と反撃を選ぶ。未表示の将来状態を利用せず、非致死swipeで予兆を止める方針を使わない。両FPSで同一方針を使い、対応根拠と実際の判断ログをQAが確認する。独立1〜4の方針を変更する場合は影響を明示して回帰する。対応前の旧bot成績は比較の合格根拠にしない。

clear／death／unfinishedを区別する。一方のみunfinishedなら比較未完了として原因とlimitを再評価する。両方死亡またはunfinishedで数値が一致しても、攻略可能性の証拠にはしない。秒数差の追加閾値は設けず、各フェーズ時間はB1〜B10で検証する。

数値差は判断時刻・位置・照準・接触距離・消費・被弾のログで診断する。帯内接触差はB10の許容対象だが、比較閾値超過を自動免除しない。Designerへ戻して比較条件または基準の再判断を記録する。帯外の同条件差、時間・表示・フェーズの規則違反はQAの不合格対象とする。walker／camperには新たなFPS成績一致条件を置かない。

### 新評価への接続と実測後の判断

難度評価を未実施のまま基準整理だけで合格にしない。

- 独立3・4：各bot・各FPSで開始hearts、clear／death／unfinished、終了時heartsと損失、秒数、被弾源、攻撃・dash回数、limit、方針・ビルド識別を報告する。失敗や差があれば判断ログを添える。新しい合計数値ゲートは現時点で設けない。
- 独立5番：上記の3／2 hearts別FPS比較と、B1〜B10・V1で二攻撃の読み取り、横移動、dash、消費、反撃機会を確認する。独立Playで最終戦の体験を観察する。bot成績だけで手応えを合格にしない。
- 通常ラン：R1〜R5で正規敵を倒した連続到達、T1〜T4で終端とretry、C1〜C3で時刻・pause・limit、V2で実機入力を確認する。状態設定した境界試験は連続到達の代用にしない。
- 時間・到達体験：§9に従い同一試行のラン時刻、pauseを分けた実経過、部屋別時間、遷移、ボス入場hearts、被弾・反撃・再挑戦回数を記録する。完走と死亡・未完了を分け、試行数を明記する。独立部屋時間の合算は禁止する。

Planは、対応botと観測経路の整備後に両FPSの基線を測り、独立QA・独立Play後、Review前にDesignerへ返す経路を含める。初回基線で明白な対処不能や到達不能が見つかればPlay前にも返す。

Designerが実測後に判断する項目は、独立3・4のbot間比較に数値ゲートが必要か、新5番のhearts別clear・被害・反撃機会に追加ゲートが必要か、連続到達と回復・retry負担に調整が必要かである。報告された試行条件・件数と独立Playを根拠に、新Decisionと仕様更新、または追加不要の理由を記録する。今ここで成功率や秒数の閾値を推定しない。

Studioは未判断項目をReview前に再ルーティングし、適用整理完了と難度・体験の検証済みを区別する。15〜20分と整合しない場合は差と原因を報告し、HPや待機だけで合わせない。承認範囲内で解消できないVision不整合、承認超過の費用・リスク、Owner Decision変更はGame Directorへ戻す。独立QA、限定Art Verify、独立Play、Reviewは省略しない。Playtester資料に本節の期待結果や§9のReview用体験信号を転記しない。

### 仕様とテストの相違

- SpitterTestのroom3試験は、その静止プレイヤーの12秒実行で最大3をassertしている。D-007はcap遅延条件で最大5を許容する。特定入力で3以下という試験と一般上限5は必ずしも矛盾しないが、この試験だけではD-007の一般境界を検証できない。条件付きの確認として保持し、cap遅延の別試験を必要とする。
- BotsTestのコメントは旧上限6を説明し、上限assertを持たない。過去構成の正本はstep44／D-006の3〜7である。新構成での下限・clear数・関連比較の適用終了と置換先はD-019および上表で確定した。テスト実装の改訂は未実施。
- combat.mdの旧13の6という記載よりstep44が優先する。step72内の旧限界への言及も現行合否値ではない。
- D-007の11.7秒表記よりstep46のstep54補足が印刷画面による算定時刻を具体化する。旧Decision本文は編集しない。
- 04が指摘する残弾・終端のコード差は未実行。新契約を実装済みや現行不具合確認済みと扱わない。

## 9. 体験評価と時間

本Stepではplay／botsを実行していない。戦闘時間、連続到達率、実行成功、指定sha一致を示す数値はない。

HP12は既存スワイプ12回であり、理論上の4回反撃を3回成立させれば倒せる値として選ぶ。実際の反撃回数は接近と向き直しで減る。秒数の目標に合わせた値ではない。初期調整の判断は「2種類を学び、複数回の反撃へ戻れるか」で行い、秒数だけを理由に増やさない。

ボス単体の秒数ゲートは設けない。連続ラン15〜20分のVisionは保持し、実測が外れたら差を報告する。範囲内の調整で整合しない場合はGame Director経由でOwnerへ戻す。

計測は同一試行で第1部屋開始から勝敗確定までのラン時刻と、pauseを分けた実経過、各部屋時間、遷移時間、ボス初入場hearts、被弾・反撃回数、再挑戦回数を記録する。終端後表示時間は戦闘時間へ加えない。独立部屋bots時間の合算を連続ラン実測として扱わない。

Review用の体験信号。PlaytesterへのHandoffには転記しない。

- 予兆から、突進と短射のどちらかを説明できる。
- 回避後に攻撃する場所を選び、単に遠ざかり続ける以外の行動が見られる。
- 被弾理由を固定射線・突進・タイミングに結び付けられる。
- ボスを通常部屋とは異なる山場と述べ、同じ回答を長時間繰り返す戦闘と述べない。
- 道中の消耗と入場回復を理解し、ボスで試す余地があったと説明する。
- 死亡後に最初から戻ることと、再挑戦方法を迷わず認識できる。

これらが成立しない場合は読みやすさ→反撃位置と時間→継承・回復の順でDesignerへ戻す。攻撃追加や新フェーズは自動採択しない。

## 10. Planへ渡す依存

1. 指定sha `27fe16268ac8`との一致、実行対象、project.mdの0.4と他資料の0.6の差を同定する。
2. D-019と§8の確定した基準対応を試験計画へ反映する。旧集計の新構成への適用は終了した。独立3・4の両FPS別報告、ボス対応dodgerの条件確認・比較、実測後のDesigner再判断を計画へ含める。適用整理を難度検証済みと扱わない。
3. 単体敵の攻撃切替、進行、終端優先順位、入力・時刻・retryを実現・観測する方式と費用を評価する。
4. 現行60秒上限を超える連続player／traceと同一試行の計測経路を用意する。必要長は実行結果とVisionの双方から評価する。
5. pause／resume、終端retry、モードと時刻基準、再試行用入力列の具体的な公開構文を確定しmanualへ反映する。
6. ボス対応botsを試験道具として明示する。対応前の成績を難度判断へ使わない。
7. Desktop実機入力の現状・対応範囲・独立検証経路を提示する。headlessビルドで実機対応済みと扱わない。
8. player表示、重なり、イベント発火の実現性とArt Directorの限定Verifyを計画する。
9. 通常到達の長時間証拠と、同時勝敗等の制御された境界試験を両方可能にする。
10. 承認された案Aを超える費用・リスクがあればBuild前に具体的影響をStudioへ返す。

実装順序、コード構造、人日見積もりは本仕様では決めない。独立QA、独立Play、Reviewを省略しない。

## 11. V1補足の確定（D-022）

Engineer handoff 46の3件への回答。D-017の契約、第1〜4部屋、共有戦闘規則、入力、HP、時間は変更しない。以下はいずれも30 FPSと60 FPSで別々に判定する。

### 11.1 旧経路（run指令なしのスクリプト）のボス表示

**採択：現行のmanualの注記を受け入れる。** §6の完全な表示契約が適用される経路は公開ドライバ（`mode run`、`mode room`）である。旧経路は旧来の独立部屋診断として60秒上限と`Player.describe`を保持し、旧経路へボス部屋を公開ドライバへ委譲する変更はしない（旧60秒挙動を変えるためD-017／D-021の範囲外）。

ただし、旧経路で`room 5`を選んだ場合に、完全な表示と誤認させないため次を必須とする。

- player viewの先頭（最初の盤面描画の前）に1行だけ出す：`note: legacy route — boss status and messages are incomplete; add "mode room" for the full boss display`
- この行は表示のみ。ゲーム状態、イベント、時刻、結果、上限を変えない。旧経路の第1〜4部屋とtrace viewには追加しない。

受け入れ基準：
- L1：旧経路`room 5`の同一スクリプトを30／60 FPSで実行し、注記行を除く出力とゲーム結果・終了時刻が変更前と一致する。60秒上限も不変。
- L2：旧経路`room 1`〜`4`と`room empty`の出力に注記行が出ない。
- L3：同じ入力列に`mode room`と`room 5`を足すと、§6の常設表示とボスメッセージが出る（V1）。
- L4：manualの旧経路注記は上記の一致を保つ。

### 11.2 弾IDと消滅理由

**要求範囲：trace view（開発者状態）と公開ドライバのイベントログ。player viewには新しい文言を足さない。** 理由：ボスの弾は同時最大1個で、player viewは既に`*`、活動中の弾数、被弾・吸収の既存メッセージを持つ。IDの露出は読み取りの助けにならない。旧経路は対象外。

- ID：`S<n>`。試行ごとに`S1`から作成順で連番、再利用しない。retryで`S1`へ戻る。ボスの弾とスピッターの弾で同じ連番を共有する。
- 発射イベントに`id`と`source`（`boss`またはスピッター識別）を含める。
- 消滅は弾1個につきちょうど1回の`shot_removed`で、`id`、`source`、`reason`、ラン時刻、部屋時刻を持つ。`reason`は次の5種のみ：
  - `lifetime`：寿命到達
  - `edge`：部屋端
  - `hit`：ダメージを与えた接触
  - `absorbed`：ダッシュまたは被弾保護による接触消費（ダメージなし）
  - `cleared`：部屋クリア・勝利・死亡確定による全消去
- 既存の`lifetime`／`edge`ログに`hit`、`absorbed`、`cleared`を追加する。接触消費は現在ログされていないため追加が必要。
- 弾が消えたフレームに、その`id`は活動中の弾数から外れる。同一フレームの発射と消滅の順序を保つ。

受け入れ基準：
- S1：B4の短射を未接触、通常命中、ダッシュ吸収、保護中接触の各場合で実行し、各弾が発射1回・消滅1回、理由がそれぞれ`lifetime`（または`edge`）、`hit`、`absorbed`、`absorbed`である。
- S2：どの場合も回復開始は発射の1.0秒後（B4）で、消滅理由に依存しない。
- S3：終端確定時に残る弾は`cleared`で1回ずつ消え、その後に`hit`が出ない（T1）。
- S4：retry後の最初の弾は`S1`。旧試行の`shot_removed`は再発しない。
- S5：player viewの出力にID文字列（`S<n>`）が現れず、既存のメッセージ文言が変更されない（V1、step94の文言保持）。

### 11.3 長時間観測

**必要な出力形と量の上限：既存の既定を保ったまま、周期出力の間隔を指定でき、最後に要約を出す。**

- `view-every <seconds>`：player viewの周期描画間隔（既定0.5、許容0.5〜60）。イベント契機の描画（§6）は間引かない。
- `trace-every <seconds>`：trace viewの周期状態行（`trace-every frame`も従来どおり許容）。イベント行は常に出す。
- `trace-every frame`は出力量の上限を設けない。使用者の選択として許容する。
- 出力間隔の指定はゲーム結果・時刻・イベント列に影響しない。
- 実行の最後に1ブロックの要約を常に出す（player／trace共通）：終了理由（clear／death／unfinished）、試行数、各試行のラン時刻、各部屋の部屋時間、ボス初入場hearts、被弾数、攻撃数、ポーズ時間を除く経過とドライバ時間、processing_seconds。
- 出力量の上限：周期行は`ceil(limit / 間隔) + 1`行以下。それ以外の行はイベント数に比例するだけで、時間に比例する出力を増やさない。

受け入れ基準：
- O1：`limit 1200`、`view-every 10`、`trace-every 5`の通常ランで、player周期描画は121以下、trace周期行は241以下。
- O2：同じスクリプトで`view-every`を0.5、10に変えても、イベントメッセージの列と最終結果が一致する。
- O3：指定なしの出力は変更前と同じ（周期0.5秒）。
- O4：要約ブロックが、勝利・死亡・limit到達（unfinished）の各終了で1回ずつ出て、数値が状態観測と一致する。
- O5：範囲外（0.5未満、60超、数値以外）の指定は実行前に拒否し、理由を出す。
- O6：20分（`limit 1200`）の通常ランを30／60 FPSで実行でき、出力は途中で切れない。

具体的な構文は上記名称を既定とするが、manualへの反映はEngineerが行う。

# Public Session driver — build 0.6-g002-public-32

D-022 observation and shot lifecycle support are implemented with automated Build probes.
Independent verification remains outstanding. The legacy script route remains available.

Run `python3 play.py --view player SCRIPT` or replace `player` with `trace`.
A script containing any new directive below selects the Session driver.

| Directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode run` | Normal run from room 1; room, spawn and player setup are rejected. |
| `mode room` | Independent diagnostic room; default for the new driver. |
| `room 5` | Diagnostic room selection, not a checkpoint. |
| `fps 30` / `fps 60` | Fixed simulation rate. |
| `attempt 2` | Subsequent timed combat inputs belong to attempt 2. |
| `control 2 pause` | Pause at driver time 2 seconds. |
| `control 4 resume` | Resume at driver time 4 seconds, even while game time is frozen. |
| `control 20 retry` | Retry at driver time 20; accepted only at a normal-run terminal. |
| `limit 1200` | Per-attempt game-time limit; distinct from combat result. |
| `driver-limit 1205` | Driver duration, including pause and terminal screens. |
| `view-every 10` | Player periodic pictures every 10 game seconds; default 0.5, range 0.5–60. |
| `trace-every 5` | Trace periodic state every 5 game seconds, range 0.5–60; default is events only. |
| `trace-every frame` | Emit trace state every driver tick without a periodic output bound. |

Timed combat inputs and existing reaction rules retain their syntax. Timed inputs use run time
in run mode and room time in diagnostic mode. Equal-time inputs retain source order.
Controls run first. Inputs due during pause or room-clear display are consumed and rejected.
Retry discards previous attempts' pending inputs. Rule cooldown and previous-view memory reset
on entry. Driver time is simulated elapsed time, not wall-clock elapsed time.

Example:

```text
mode run
fps 60
limit 10
driver-limit 13
0 dash right
control 0.1 pause
0.1 attack
control 2.1 resume
```

For a diagnostic boss display:

```text
mode room
room 5
fps 30
limit 8
trace-every frame
```

The public player view displays both game clocks, room, hearts, boss phase and next attack,
warning direction and dimensions, recovery time, and active shot count. The `~` cells approximate
the fixed path: they are not the exact continuous collision boundary. Charge path length is
2.4 tiles with contact radius 0.6; short-shot range is 3.0 tiles with contact radius 0.4.

The public syntax and boss instructions are now included in manual.md and linked from README.md.
The legacy route remains separate and lacks complete boss presentation.

Periodic scheduling resets on retry. Numeric intervals bound periodic output per attempt to
`ceil(limit / interval) + 1`; event messages and event-triggered pictures are preserved.
Default player scheduling retains the existing half-second cadence after event pictures.

Exactly one final `summary:` block reports execution stop, clear/death/unfinished outcome,
source id, processing seconds, total driver seconds, and every attempt's run and room times,
first boss-entry hearts, hurt and attack counts, pauses, paused seconds, driver seconds and
elapsed driver seconds excluding pauses. Terminal waiting is included only in driver elapsed
time. See manual.md for shot IDs, removal reasons and legacy-route limitations.

Remaining work: Split C normal-run pause/retry measurements and retained dodger regression
fixation, followed by independent QA, limited Art Verify, Play and Designer judgment.
Legacy boss presentation remains intentionally limited under D-022; delegation to the public
driver is not required. No real keyboard or gamepad verification is claimed under D-021.

frame rounding. The walker and camper do not read the new cues; the dodger does.
