# Dash availability display (G-003, step 04)

Status: built (QA 10 verified source `b62005468da6`); step 12 rulings applied (D-029). Display and wording only. Dash length (0.25 s), distance (4 tiles), invulnerability (full dash), cooldown (0.6 s) and the input set (D-001) do not change. Governs the player-view text for dash. `design/combat.md` "Player kit" carries the documented timing (edited in the same step).

## 1. Intent

A player who has only the screen and the manual can tell, at any moment, whether a dash would work now. If it would not, the player can tell how long until it does. The exact moment dash returns is announced, so the player does not have to poll with failed presses.

## 2. Documented behavior (what the build does today; not a rule change)

Evidence: play runs `cd-start` (60 FPS, practice room, legacy route) and the earlier dash-cooldown probe. Both used the player view only; trace view not run.

| Fact | Evidence |
|---|---|
| A dash lasts 0.25 s. | Rule in combat.md. |
| The 0.6 s cooldown starts when the dash ENDS, not when it starts. A dash is refused until `dash start + 0.25 + 0.6 = start + 0.85 s`. | `cd-start`: dash at 0.500 accepted. Presses at 1.300 and 1.333 refused. Press at 1.350 accepted (= 0.5 + 0.85). Probe 1: refused at 0.7 s, accepted 1.0 s after start. |
| A dash press during the dash itself is refused. | Probe 1 (0.3 s after start). Run 2: press at 1.400 refused (dash 1.2–1.45). |
| An enemy wind-up does not block a dash and does not change the cooldown. | Run 2: dash accepted at 0.050 while a grub was winding up (started 0.017). Next dash accepted at 1.200 (start + 1.15 s). |
| Hit-stun (0.3 s after a hit) ignores all input, so a dash press there is refused. | Run 2: hit at 2.150, press at 2.200 refused although the cooldown had ended at 2.05. This run does NOT show whether a hit changes the cooldown. |
| Entering a room clears the cooldown. | `design/final-boss-and-continuous-run.md` §2 ("攻撃回復、ダッシュ待ち時間 → 0"). Specified there; not re-observed in this step. |

Observed by QA in report 10 (step 12, recorded as the build's behavior, not changed):
- A hit does not change the cooldown (Q3). The first accepted press is max(ready, hit + 0.3 s).
- The 0.35 s attack recovery does not block a dash (Q4). A dash pressed during it is accepted.
- At 30 FPS the dash occupies 8 frames (0.267 s) and the second dash is first accepted 27 frames (0.900 s) after the first one started, with `dash ready` at 1.500 for a dash at 0.6 s. At 60 FPS it is 0.850 s (ready 1.450). This is frame quantization; the display agrees with the build. Whether it predates this Goal cannot be shown (no earlier build); this Goal changed no timing.

The escalation condition (a cooldown that differs between situations in a way that cannot be documented) did NOT fire on the evidence available. If QA finds it does (for example a hit resets or extends the cooldown), QA reports and the Studio routes a `game-director` question. The rule below is then not applied.

## 3. Rules

### 3.1 Dash state

At any moment the dash is in exactly one state:

- **active**: from the accepted press until 0.25 s later.
- **unavailable**: not active, and the build would refuse a press. Reasons: cooldown (until dash end + 0.6 s), hit-stun (until 0.3 s after the hit), or any other condition under which the build refuses a dash (the attack recovery, if QA finds that it blocks).
- **ready**: not active and a press would be accepted.

**Time to usable** (`R`): the seconds until the state becomes ready, assuming no new dash and no new hit. While active, `R` = rest of the dash + 0.6 s. Otherwise `R` = the longest remaining unavailable reason. All displayed times use `R` shown to one decimal, rounded UP with a 1 ms tolerance: `ceil((R − 0.001) × 10) / 10`. The display therefore never shows ready, or less time, early. Examples: R = 0.45 shows `0.5 s`; R = 0.600 shows `0.6 s`; R = 0.85 shows `0.9 s`.

The cooldown runs on game time. It is frozen by pause and stays in seconds.

**Frame quantization (step 12, D-029; documents the build, not a rule change).** State changes happen on frames. A press is accepted on the first frame at or after the ready moment, and the dash itself covers whole frames. The expected start-to-start is therefore **0.850 s at 60 FPS and 0.900 s at 30 FPS**, and the expected ready time after a dash started at 0.6 s is 1.450 s (60) and 1.500 s (30). The ±1 frame tolerance in this document is measured against these frame-quantized values, not against the nominal 0.85 s. The displayed `usable again in 0.9 s` is correct at both rates. The display never shows ready or a smaller time before a press would be accepted.

### 3.2 Persistent status (A)

Every player-view picture of live play (periodic and event pictures, and the pictures printed in a pause) ends its hearts/status line with one dash field:

| State | Field |
|---|---|
| ready | `dash: ready` |
| active | `dash: active` |
| unavailable | `dash: <R> s` (for example `dash: 0.4 s`) |

Example: `[1.00 s] hearts 3/3 — dash: 0.5 s`. In public-driver run/room mode the field goes at the end of the existing `run — room n/5 — hearts h/3 …` status line, or on the line that carries hearts; the words and format above are fixed, the placement within that line is the Build step's. Clear screens and terminal (win/death) screens carry no dash field.

A picture shows the state at the time printed in its own header. Between pictures the number goes stale. That is stated in the manual, and the `dash ready` message (3.3) is the exact signal.

### 3.3 Messages (B)

- **Accepted dash.** `you dash <dir> — usable again in 0.9 s`. The prefix `you dash <dir>` is unchanged, so `text "you dash"` rules still match. The 0.9 is the rounded 0.85 s (also the true value at 30 FPS). Legacy route: no extra picture. Public driver: the driver's usual event picture follows, as after swipe-miss and `(nothing happens)` (step 12, accepted).
- **Refused dash** (replaces `(nothing happens)` for a dash press): `dash not ready — <R> s left`, with a reason suffix when it is not the cooldown: ` (dashing)` while the dash is active, ` (hit-stun)` while hit-stun is the longest reason, (the attack recovery does not block, so it has no reason). Legacy route: no extra picture. Public driver: the usual event picture follows. This holds for a refusal from any source: scripted press, public-driver rule or legacy rule (step 12). `text "not ready"` may fire on it. `(nothing happens)` stays for any non-dash input that does nothing.
- **Ready.** `dash ready`, printed at the moment `R` reaches 0, followed by an event picture whose field reads `dash: ready`. It is printed only if a dash has been used since the previous `dash ready` or since room entry. It is printed at most once per dash. If hit-stun or another reason outlasts the cooldown, it is printed when the last reason ends. A hit that never involved a dash prints nothing at stun end; the field still counts down.
- Order inside a frame: `dash ready` is emitted before that frame's input is processed, so a press at exactly the ready time is accepted and the `dash ready` line comes first. If the ready moment coincides with other events in one frame, one picture is printed and no message is lost.
- No `dash ready` after death, after the room is cleared, or while paused. Room entry resets the state to ready without a message; the entry picture shows `dash: ready`.

### 3.4 Where it applies (D-028)

- Legacy route (scripts without new directives), including `room empty` and rooms 1–5: yes. The `room 5` note line stays as it is.
- Public driver (`mode run`, `mode room`), including the boss room: yes.
- Trace view: adds developer records `dash_start`, `dash_end` and `dash_ready` (with ids and run/room times) so QA can check section 2. Names are the Build step's choice.
- Reaction rules: `text "dash ready"` and `text "not ready"` become usable like any message. Rules such as `hearts <= n` and `see <mark>` read game state, not the new field; the Build step checks that the extra field cannot break them.
- Rule-driven presses (step 12): a dash refused for a rule prints the same `dash not ready — …` line as a scripted press, on the legacy route and in the public driver. A rule acts at most every 0.15 s, so this is at most about 6 lines per second. Rule-driven attacks that do nothing keep printing `(nothing happens)` where they do today.

### 3.5 What does not change

Game results are unchanged: hearts, hit times, events, summary numbers, the periodic picture grid (every 0.5 s on the fixed grid), and `view-every`. The only new output is the dash field, the changed dash/refusal message text and the `dash ready` message with its event picture. The `dash ready` pictures are event pictures: they count as event output, bounded by one per 0.85 s of play, and not as periodic lines. In the public driver the event pictures after accepted-dash and refusal messages also count as event output (one per press); they are bounded by the press rate, not by the periodic bound.

### 3.6 Edge cases

- Press at the exact ready time: accepted (probe: ready = 1.350 accepted, 1.333 refused at 60 FPS). At 30 FPS the ready frame is the frame-quantized one (3.1): a dash started at 0.6 s is accepted at 1.500, refused at 1.467.
- Press while a dash is queued or while an attack is queued: queued-input display is out of scope.
- Dash into a room transition: the state resets at entry (section 2).
- Pause: the field and `R` are frozen; resuming continues.
- Hit while active: the dash continues (dash is invulnerable, so this occurs only by a blocked contact); no state change.
- Hit during cooldown: cooldown end unchanged; `R` = max(cooldown remaining, stun remaining).
- Death: the final picture carries no field.
- Dash pressed during the first frame after resume or entry: handled as any input.

## 4. Open questions

- Hit during cooldown and attack recovery vs dash: answered by QA 10 (section 2); no open question.
- Q5 (room-entry reset) is still unobserved; see Q5.
- Whether a human finds one decimal and the `dash:` words clear: for the independent playtest.
- Dash invulnerability display and queued inputs: out of scope (proposed Goals from diagnose).

## 5. Acceptance criteria: player-visible (QA and the independent playtester)

Use the player view only, `room empty`, `fps 30` and `fps 60`. All times ±1 frame (0.033 s at 30 FPS, 0.017 s at 60 FPS) against the frame-quantized values of 3.1 (start-to-start 0.85 s at 60 FPS, 0.90 s at 30 FPS); displayed numbers equal the exact value rounded as in 3.1, or the neighbouring value when the exact value is within 1 frame of a rounding boundary.

Script P (a dash at 0.6 s, then presses at 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 1.5 s, `end 3`):

- **P1.** Every picture before the first dash shows `dash: ready`.
- **P2.** At 0.6 s the message is `you dash right — usable again in 0.9 s`.
- **P3.** The press at 0.7 s prints `dash not ready — 0.8 s left (dashing)`.
- **P4.** The periodic picture at 1.00 s ends with `dash: 0.5 s`. The press at 1.0 s prints `dash not ready — 0.5 s left`.
- **P5.** The press at 1.4 s prints `dash not ready — 0.1 s left`.
- **P6.** `dash ready` is printed at 1.45 s (60 FPS) or 1.50 s (30 FPS), followed by a picture ending with `dash: ready`. The picture at 1.50 s also shows `dash: ready`, and the press at 1.5 s prints `you dash …`.
- **P7.** Total: the second dash is refused one frame before and accepted at the frame-quantized start-to-start: 0.85 s at 60 FPS, 0.90 s at 30 FPS. It is never accepted earlier than that minus one frame.
- **P8.** Script with only a dash at 0.6 s and no later presses: `dash ready` appears once, at 1.45 s. Script with no dash and a hit: no `dash ready` appears.
- **P9.** A press during hit-stun while the cooldown has ended prints `dash not ready — <R> s left (hit-stun)` with `R` ≤ 0.3 s.
- **P10.** Reading rule: at no time does a picture or message say ready (or a time of 0.0) when the next dash press is refused, nor refuse/show a time when the dash press would be accepted (±1 frame).
- **P11.** The same checks hold with a grub in wind-up near the player (the cooldown is not changed by wind-ups).
- **P12.** A dodger-bot or scripted run of room 3 and of the boss room (`mode room`, `room 5`) shows the field in every live picture and `dash ready` after each dash that is not followed by death or room clear.

- **P13 (rule-driven refusals, step 12).** The same held rule `when nothing within 20 then dash right`, run on the legacy route and with `mode room`: every refused press prints `dash not ready — <R> s left` (with its reason suffix), and a second rule `when text "not ready" then move up` fires on it. Also one rule using a different action type (for example `when see g within 3 then dash toward`) on both routes, so that route and action type can be told apart.

## 6. Acceptance criteria: QA with trace and bots

- **Q1 (cooldown start).** Trace shows `dash_ready` = `dash_end + 0.6 s` ±1 frame at 30 and 60 FPS (QA 10: +1 frame at 30, exactly +0.6 at 60). A press 1 frame before is refused (at 60 FPS: dash at 0.6, press at 1.433 refused, 1.450 accepted), a press at ready is accepted. Start-to-start is 0.85 s at 60 FPS and 0.90 s at 30 FPS.
- **Q2 (rates).** Q1 and P1–P10 hold at both rates.
- **Q3 (after hit).** Hit during the cooldown (after the dash ended, before ready): the ready time is unchanged, and the first accepted press is at max(ready, hit + 0.3 s). If the build differs, QA reports `outcome: question`; it is not a defect to patch.
- **Q4 (attack recovery).** A press during the 0.35 s attack recovery after a swipe: record accept/refuse. If refused, the refusal shows an `R` that covers it and the field is not `ready`.
- **Q5 (room entry).** In `mode run`, a dash used just before a room clear: the next room's entry picture shows `dash: ready` and a press at entry time is accepted; no `dash ready` message at entry. Script idea, trace view: take a first run to find the time k of the last kill in room 1. In a second run, start a dash at k − 0.25 and queue the final killing swipe during it (an attack pressed during a dash fires when it ends), so the swipe lands at k with the 0.6 s cooldown just starting. Read the trace: if `dash_ready` is logged during the clear screen (about k + 0.6), the cooldown runs on the clear screen, so it is always over before entry; the reset is then unobservable and the criterion reduces to "ready at entry, press accepted, no message". If `dash_ready` is logged only at entry, the cooldown was pending and the entry reset is confirmed. Either result is recorded; neither is a defect.
- **Q6 (pause).** Pause during the cooldown: the field and the ready time shift by the paused time; `dash ready` is not printed during the pause.
- **Q7 (consistency).** Evidence method (no Build change): from the trace of a 60 s dodger-bot run per rate (rooms 3 and 4) and a `mode room` `room 5` run, every `dash_start` is at or after the previous `dash_ready`, and no `dash_ready` is followed by a refusal before a new `dash_start` unless the stun or an active dash explains it. Per-press checks stay in the scripted runs (P10).
- **Q8 (no side effects; evidence rule, D-029 after D-024).** No earlier build and no strip tool exist, so "identical to before" is not claimed and not byte-compared. Accepted evidence: (a) recorded earlier numbers (dodger hearts lost and dash counts per room, normal-run clear times, the 60 FPS dash probe in section 2, hit times of earlier QA handoffs) compared at their recorded precision; (b) in the same build, the periodic pictures stay on the 0.5 s grid including after dash event pictures, event order is unchanged by dash output, and the trace game events do not depend on the view; (c) the existing test suite. Anything not covered is reported as unverifiable and is not a pass.
- **Q9 (modes).** The field appears in legacy `room empty` and rooms 1–5, and in `mode run`/`mode room` including the boss room. Legacy room 5 keeps its note line. Clear/terminal screens have no field.
- **Q10 (output bound).** O1 of `final-boss-and-continuous-run.md` §11.3 holds: periodic lines stay within `ceil(limit/interval)+1`; `dash ready` pictures are event output.
- **Q11 (rules).** `text "dash ready"` fires a reaction rule once per ready moment.
- **Q12 (G-002 L1 rebased).** L1 is evaluated with the note line, the dash field, dash/refusal text and `dash ready` lines stripped (D-028). With no baseline the comparison cannot be made (D-024 item 1); QA checks only that the legacy room 5 note line is exact and the field is present, and reports the rest as unverifiable. G-002 is stopped (D-027).

## 7. Experience signals (playtest and Review; not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A player can say, without trying a press, whether they can dash now.
- A player who presses too early says they got a number and waited, rather than guessing.
- A player can say when dash returns after a dash ("about a second later") and plans the next dash.
- A player does not report dash as "sometimes ignored" or "invisible".
- The extra field and `dash ready` lines are not described as clutter in busy fights (rooms 4–5, boss).

## 8. Drop-in text for `repo/manual.md` (Build step applies; not on the designer's write list)

Replace the Dash line in "Controls" with:

> - **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face), 0.25 s. You cannot be hurt while dashing. After a dash it needs 0.6 s before you can dash again, counted from the moment the dash ends. So the next dash can start 0.85 s after the previous one started (60 FPS); at 30 FPS the frames make it 0.9 s. Pictures after the dash messages in a `mode` run are the usual event pictures.

Add a new section after "Warnings":

> ## Dash status
>
> Every picture shows the dash at the end of the status line (`hearts 3/3 — dash: ready`):
>
> | Shown | Meaning |
> |---|---|
> | `dash: ready` | A dash will work now. |
> | `dash: active` | You are dashing right now. |
> | `dash: 0.4 s` | A dash will work in about 0.4 s, rounded up to a tenth. |
>
> A picture shows the state at the time written in its header; pictures come every half second, so the number can be older than the moment you act. The exact moment is announced: when the dash returns the game prints `dash ready` and a picture. A dash prints `you dash right — usable again in 0.9 s`. A dash that cannot happen prints `dash not ready — 0.3 s left`, with `(dashing)` or `(hit-stun)` if that is the reason. Being hit stops all input for 0.3 s, and a dash pressed then is refused. Entering a room makes the dash ready. `dash ready` is printed only when a dash was used before it. A dash refused for a reaction rule prints the same line, and rules can use `text "dash ready"` and `text "not ready"`.

Also add to the Reactions table or the example list: `text "dash ready"` is an example of a message condition. In the "Script" table nothing changes.

## 9. Changed documents

- `design/combat.md`: Dash line in "Player kit" (cooldown start point, availability display, pointer to this document).
- `repo/manual.md`: section 8 above (Build applies).
- `decisions/D-028-dash-indicator-on-legacy-route.md`.
- `decisions/D-029-g003-spec-rulings.md` (step 12).
