# Studio operation packet

operation: Route
goal: G-001
step_artifacts: goals/G-001-first-playable-run/13-qa-to-studio.md
next_seq: 14
context_request: allowed once (@need, up to 8 paths)
current_build: repo/ (sha 2583f02b8f24; run through the project's run commands)
log: last 5 of 6 entries in @log-recent; the full history is goals/G-001-first-playable-run/log.md
goal_budget: 14 of 19 operations used

## You may write

- goals/G-001-first-playable-run/goal.md
- goals/G-001-first-playable-run/13-qa-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to and any Sender assessment)
- project.md: only in the Route that closes the Goal, and only its ## Current state (at most 1,500 characters)
- goals/G-001-first-playable-run/NN-studio-to-<role or owner>.md: up to 3 new artifacts, consecutive NN starting at 14
- @need: instead of all other files, once: a file block `<<<FILE @need` with one path per line (up to 8 project or Studio files), then `>>>END`, to add them to this packet before you route

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create as one complete file block: `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the
  full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line. To change part of an existing file, you may
  instead write `<<<EDIT <path>` with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> REPLACE` pairs and
  `>>>END` (Output protocol); each SEARCH must match the file exactly once, so include enough
  lines. Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project
  directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.
- Nothing exists beyond this packet and what it offers: build runs (`@run`), one request for more
  files (`@need`), and the operations that follow. There is no other environment, staff, device,
  budget or log store, so never ask the Owner for them; say plainly what your means cannot show.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record (current state and route plan) and an append-only Goal log (history). | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md`, `log.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

`goal.md` holds the Goal's current state; its history is the **Goal log**, `log.md` in the
Goal's directory. After every Intake, Route and Resume, whoever runs the operation appends one
entry (an isolated runtime does it itself): the operation and date, the Goal's status and open
steps, and the *Route changes* text just written. Entries are never edited or removed, and no Role
or Studio operation rewrites the log. Every operation keeps *Owner request* exactly as quoted at
Intake. Only Resume, after an Owner decision, may change *Interpretation*; a Route that would need
to reinterpret the Goal escalates instead.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) with its **budget**: the operations the Goal should need,
   two per planned stage (its Step and the Route after it), plus four for one return through
   two stages (e.g., back to Design and Build), plus one for Intake. Then
   write the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the last few entries of the Goal log, the latest Handoff, this file,
`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps 4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the
files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and say why under
   *Route changes* in one to three lines (600 characters at most), replacing the previous text
   (the Goal log keeps the history; the Handoffs carry the details). Keep *Unknowns* current the
   same way: update a stage's line, do not narrate earlier passes. Confirm (`planned`) or drop
   (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition this result settles. The route is a plan,
   not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
   If the Owner's choice ends the Goal (stop, abandon, or accept it as it is), Close instead: no
   next step, `status: done` or `abandoned`, the Outcome saying plainly what was and was not
   achieved, and the Current state brought up to date.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).
Then bring `project.md`'s `## Current state` up to date with what exists now (build, content,
known problems, how to run it; 1,500 characters at most), so the next Goal starts from the facts.
Nothing else in `project.md` changes: the rest belongs to the Owner.

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.
4. One question at a time: while an Escalation is open, do not open another. Later questions wait
   for the answer, or go into the next Escalation once it is resolved.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff. A Decision is never
edited once written, not even for a typo or a stray line: a change is a new Decision that
`supersedes:` it, so do not route an edit of one to a Role.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
- **Budget.** The runtime counts a Goal's operations and shows them against `goal.md`'s budget.
  Once the budget is used, a Route adds no stages but one: a `game-director` step that cuts the
  remaining work to what the Owner request needs (scope within the Goal; the rest is then
  `skipped`), or an `owner` step that escalates the cost. Planned steps may still be opened, and
  the loop limits' re-plan steps give way to the scope decision. Only the Owner changes the
  budget, in a Resume.
- `partial` is not a question: nothing is missing, so route the rest of the work back to the same
  Role and never escalate for it. The same work handed back `partial` three times in a row →
  route to `technical-director` to split or re-plan it.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Ember Hollow (new concept)

## Vision

A short turn-based roguelike. The player descends five floors of a cave carrying a single ember.
The ember is both light and time: its glow is how far the player can see, it dims a little every
turn, and only the braziers scattered through the floors rekindle it. The creatures of the hollow
live in the dark and react to the light. Floor 5 holds the creature that keeps the hollow dark;
beating it wins the run. Dying, or letting the ember go out, ends it.

Pillars:

1. **Every turn is a decision.** Move, wait, fight or use an item; every threat that can hurt the
   player next turn is visible and readable before it does.
2. **Light is the resource.** Seeing farther and having more time are the same thing; spending the
   ember is the core trade-off of a run.
3. **A run is short and different each time.** A whole run takes 15 to 30 minutes. Floors are made
   from a seed, so every seed is a different run, and the same seed is always the same run.

## Player profile

Players who enjoy short roguelikes: they like learning how each creature behaves and planning a
few turns ahead, and accept losing a run to learn from it. They play with a keyboard, or by
clicking, in a browser.

## Current state

Concept only. Nothing has been designed or built: `repo/` holds only a README. There are no
design documents and no Decisions yet.

## Constraints

- The build is JavaScript for Node.js 20 and the browser, with no dependencies and no network
  use, in `repo/`. The game's rules live in code that both ways of playing share.
- **For people: a browser page.** `repo/index.html` opens straight from the file system (no
  server) and is played with the keyboard or the mouse. It draws the floor as a grid.
- **For the team: input scripts.** `run_play` (`node play.js {script}`) plays a script and prints
  what the player sees, as text, turn by turn; `run_trace` adds the internal state; `run_tests`
  (`node --test`) runs the build's tests. The script format (including how a run's seed is
  chosen) is the build's to define, in `repo/manual.md`, which ships with the build and is all a
  player is told.
- Deterministic: the same seed and the same commands always give the same run.

## Design index

None yet.

# G-001: First complete playable run in the browser

## Owner request

> このコンセプトで、最初から最後まで通して遊べる版を作ってほしい。ブラウザで遊べるようにしてほしい

## Interpretation

Success condition: a person opens `repo/index.html` straight from the file system in a browser and can play one whole run with keyboard or mouse. The run starts on floor 1, passes through all five floors, and ends in one of the ways the vision names: beating the floor-5 creature (win), dying, or the ember going out. No setup, server or developer step is needed. The vision's pillars hold in that run: readable threats, light as the resource, a short seeded run (same seed gives the same run).

The team-side means from `project.md#constraints` also ship, because verification depends on them: `node play.js {script}`, `--trace`, `node --test`, and `repo/manual.md` (the script format and everything a player is told).

Out of scope (not requested): saving or resuming runs, meta-progression between runs, sound, mobile or touch layouts, network features, content beyond what one complete five-floor run needs, and any change to the vision or pillars.

## Unknowns

- Observe: skipped. No build exists and nothing is reported broken or off.
- Diagnose: skipped. There is no problem to explain.
- Decide: skipped. Design stayed inside the vision and Goal scope and raised no direction, priority or scope choice. Reopens only if Plan or a spec question finds scope must change (then `game-director`).
- Design: done. 30 checks; check 14 settled by D-002; flare stun timing, hound bite at distance 1, lit/unlit brazier reach marks ruled (handoff 10). Balance is unverified; Play must report it.
- Plan: done (handoff 03). Reasoning only, nothing measured.
- Build: done (handoff 12). Reach marks, trace fields and the unlit-brazier Gloom rule are in code; `node --test` passed 49/49 in the runtime's check. The engineer ran no scripts directly, so QA must.
- Verify: open (qa, handoff 12). Checks 27-30 need a human opening `index.html`; QA reports them as not verifiable by text runs. Art Director visual review skipped: the budget does not cover it and no executor can see the page, so grid and mark readability stay open for the Owner.
- Play: planned. A Playtester plays from `repo/manual.md` and the player profile only.
- Review: planned. `game-director` judges whether the intent was met and names the next issues.

## Route changes

After Build (12, partial): the code work is finished and tests pass; remaining unrun checks are QA's to run, so 12 goes to qa (self-assessment stays out of QA's view). 5b skipped for budget (13 of 19 used after this Route; QA, Route, Play, Route, Review, Close fit exactly). No further returns possible.

## Next action

Start step 5a: `qa` with `12-gameplay-engineer-to-qa.md`, in a fresh executor context. The Route after it composes a fresh Handoff for the Playtester from the build, `repo/manual.md` and the player profile only.

<<<FILE @log-recent
## 003-route · 2026-10-26

Status: active. Open: 02-game-designer-to-technical-director.md.

After Design: it fits the plan. Decide dropped (skipped): the designer resolved all ambiguities inside the vision and scope. Plan opens with the Design handoff; its Load list was corrected to the existing skill `technical-plan`.

## 005-route · 2026-10-26

Status: active. Open: 03-technical-director-to-gameplay-engineer.md, 04-studio-to-game-designer.md.

After Plan: it fits. Build opens (03). The TD's spec question on check 14 vs threat marks opens as a parallel Design step (04); Build does not consume its answer. Verify waits for both. Skills in 03's Load set to implement-change.

## 008-route · 2026-10-26

Status: active. Open: 07-studio-to-gameplay-engineer.md, 08-studio-to-game-designer.md.

After Build (05, partial) and Design 4b (06): check 14 is settled by D-002 reach marks, so Build continues with those changes (07). 05's two other rule questions go to a parallel Design step (08). Verify waits for both. 05 is not sent to qa. Budget is nearly used up: a further return would pass it.

## 011-route · 2026-10-26

Status: active. Open: 11-studio-to-gameplay-engineer.md.

After Build (09, partial) and Design 4c (10, done): both rulings ratify the built readings; one check (Gloom on unlit braziers) may need code. 09 is not sent to qa: Build continues (11) with old tests, trace fields and real runs. Budget: 11 of 19 used; remaining steps must not return again.

## 013-route · 2026-10-26

Status: active. Open: 12-gameplay-engineer-to-qa.md.

After Build (12, partial): the code work is finished and tests pass; remaining unrun checks are QA's to run, so 12 goes to qa (self-assessment stays out of QA's view). 5b skipped for budget (13 of 19 used after this Route; QA, Route, Play, Route, Review, Close fit exactly).

# 13: qa → studio — verification of the reach-mark Build: `node --test` green (49/49); checks 27-30 and play-level evidence for 14, 26 and 29 still missing

## Task

Decide the next step. All visible automated evidence is green, but I cannot give a full `pass`. Checks 27-30 need a human at `repo/index.html`. For checks 14, 13, 26 and 29 I have no first-hand play-level evidence beyond the tests. Route a Playtester step, or a human page check, as the Studio sees fit.

## Context

G-001. Handoff 12 asked QA to verify checks 14, 13, 26 and 29 and to regress checks 1-26. I used what the packet offered:
- The runtime's Build check of `node --test` on this exact build.
- One trace run (round 1, `seed42-walk`).

The trace run's output is truncated in the middle. I did not use the remaining rounds, because a blind script cannot reach a hound or Gloom situation. play.js can only start from a seed and walk, and the layout of seed 42 beyond the start room is not known to me. The hand-made scenarios exist only as test fixtures.

## Findings

Only what I observed is reported.

**Observed: `node --test`, exit 0 (runtime Build check)**
- Totals: tests 49, pass 49, fail 0, cancelled 0, skipped 0.
- The packet shows only the tail of the listing. Visible passing tests: the strict sampled-states test, checks 1-8, 19, 20 and 24, check 25, the two visibility tests, check 9.1-9.9, and the view/rules agreement test.
- Visible diagnostics from the strict check-14 test in `reach.test.js` (20 random-walk seeds `c14-*`):
  - "damage events: threat 12, reach 7".
  - Each event is listed with its case; the visible ones involve moths.
  - No unmarked damage was reported, and the test would fail on one.
- Not visible to me:
  - The names and results of the individual `g001-final`, `bots` (check 14 strict, check 26), `creatures`, `rules`, `floors`, `gloom` and `view` tests.
  - The bot damage-count diagnostic and the check-26 seed summary (turn counts, victory).
  - All of that is inside the 49/0 totals but I cannot cite it per test.

**Observed: trace run, seed 42 (round 1, first ~16 and last ~6 commands visible; the middle is cut)**
- The frame layout, the legend (including `? reach mark`) and the `Danger: none` line print as in manual.md.
- The refusal path works: walking into a wall prints "(refused: no turn passed)", the turn and E stay unchanged, and the trace shows `consumed=false ... drain=0/turn`.
- Using empty slots 1-4 added the messages "Slot N is empty." Turn count and E stayed at 31 and 69 across the refused commands (visible in the tail). I did not see the frames of the slot commands themselves, because they fall in the cut.
- Dimming and radius: E fell 1 per consumed turn. At turn 31, E = 69 and r = 5, with the message "Your light shrinks." I did not see the E = 80→79 step itself in the visible part. The values at E = 69 and the message are consistent with spec section 3.
- Trace format: `[trace] command N ("c") turn T consumed=... E=... drain=.../turn`, per-creature lines with pathdist, `threats before action`, `events`.
- No damage event occurred in the visible part, so I have not seen a `case=… markedBefore=…` line in a real run. That format is asserted only by the `g001-final` trace test, whose result I take from the 49/0 total.
- All four moths on floor 1 stayed idle with pathdist ≥ 18, so no creature interaction was exercised.

**Verdicts**

| Check | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| 1-8, 19, 20, 24, 25 | pass | Named tests passed in the listing visible to me. |
| 9-12, 15-18, 21-23 | not individually observed | Presumably covered by the tests not visible in the truncated listing; no per-test evidence available. |
| 13 (flare timing) | not individually observed | The test is in `g001-final.test.js`; the visible output does not show it. It is covered only by the 49/0 total, not confirmed. |
| 14 (strict) | pass for the random-walk portion; hand-made cases not individually observed | See the random-walk evidence above. Unlit/lit brazier, Gloom, hound, shade-at-r=2 and stairs cases are in `reach.test.js` and `g001-final.test.js`, covered only by the 49/0 total. |
| 26 (run length, bot wins) | not individually observed | The test exists and the suite is green, but I did not see the seed summary, so I cannot state turn counts or the winning seed. |
| 29 (reach marks, visual) | code/text only | Text: the `?` glyph and `Danger:` line are in the legend and covered by test. The browser appearance was not seen. |
| 27, 28, 30 | not verifiable by text runs | A human must open `repo/index.html`. Reported as not verified, not passed. |

**Independent reading of the changed code (not an execution)**
- `view.js`:
  - An unlit brazier neighbour is evaluated with E = min(100, E+60) minus that tile's drain.
  - Creatures other than the Gloom are skipped there; the Gloom goes through `planAction` and `hurtsAt`.
  - Stairs, walls and creature tiles get no reach entry.
  - A lit brazier is treated like floor.
  - This matches spec section 9 item 7 and the check-14 text.
- `script.js` `stepLogged`:
  - `moved` is derived from the player position only.
  - A descent onto `>` changes the floor, so `moved` is true with a new floor's position. A descent has no creature phase, so no damage event arises. The random-walk test in `reach.test.js` guards this explicitly with `res.state.floor === st.floor`; `stepLogged` has no such guard. This is harmless unless a damage event ever occurs on a descent turn, which the spec rules out.
- Known gap 2 (neighbour tile whose creature is hidden by a wall): the "shown" filter includes creatures orthogonally adjacent to the player or a neighbour tile, so such a creature is evaluated for reach marks. I saw no dedicated scenario for it in the packet, and I did not verify it by running. Treat as unverified.
- Known gap 3 (random walks rarely meet hounds or the Gloom) stands. Bot runs presumably reach floor 5 where a bot wins, but I did not see this.

**Defects:** none found. I have not reproduced a failure.
**Spec gaps:** none found.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: classic-script UMD modules.
- D-002: threat plus reach marks, after-dimming E, strict check 14. Handoff 10 rulings applied (flare reading A, hound bite at distance 1, lit brazier marked, unlit brazier marked by the Gloom only).

## Constraints

- QA did not modify production code or tests.
- No criterion is passed that was not observed.
- Checks 27-30 need a human at `repo/index.html`; no text run can show them.
- Remaining QA means are two more runs, with a script only starting from a seed. Without a known route, they cannot reach a hound or Gloom situation. Further assurance of checks 13, 14 and 26 should come from a test listing that shows per-test results, not from more blind scripts.

## Open questions

- None for the Game Designer.
- For the Studio: is the 49/0 `node --test` result, with the per-test results for checks 13, 14 (hand-made) and 26 not visible to QA, enough to proceed to the Playtester? If the full listing is needed, a later QA step can request it through a `tests` run with the full listing (diagnostics included) on `reach.test.js`, `g001-final.test.js` and `bots.test.js`.

## Expected output

- Addressed to `studio`.
- Suggested next step: a Playtester step on `repo/manual.md` and `node play.js` for the experience signals, plus a human opening `repo/index.html` for checks 27-30.
- A fresh Playtester Handoff must be composed from permitted information only. It should carry no implementation details from this file, only the manual and the play/trace commands.
- If the Studio wants a full QA pass first, the follow-up QA step should run `node --test` with per-test output and read the check 13, 14 and 26 diagnostics.
