# D-001: Shared code is plain classic-script modules (UMD style), not ES modules

## Decision

All code under `repo/src/` that both `play.js` and the page use is written as classic scripts with a small UMD wrapper. In Node it exports with `module.exports`. In the browser it attaches to one global namespace, `EmberHollow`. `repo/index.html` loads the files with ordinary `<script src="src/...">` tags in dependency order. No `import`/`export` syntax and no bundler anywhere in `repo/`. Only the page's own UI code (`repo/src/page.js`) is browser-only. The rules code never touches `window`, `document`, `Date`, `Math.random` or any other real-time or environmental input.

## Rationale

`repo/index.html` must open from the file system. Browsers block `<script type="module">` files loaded over `file://` (origin and CORS rules), so ES modules would break the one requirement the Owner stated. Classic scripts work from `file://` and under Node 20 without a build step, and they keep the "no dependencies" constraint.

## Alternatives considered

- ES modules: rejected because they fail on `file://`.
- A bundler or a generated single file: rejected because it adds a build step and a tool dependency, and the generated file would drift from the sources.
- Duplicating the rules for the page: rejected because the constraint requires shared rules code.

## Revisit when

The project gains a server, or a build step is allowed by the constraints.
