# D-004: pictures are drawn by code on the canvas; a pure scene module maps the view model to pictures

## Decision

1. **Method.** Every picture is vector drawing code (canvas 2D paths and fills) in a new classic-script module `repo/src/pictures.js` (UMD, D-001). There are no image files, no embedded data URIs and no inline SVG. Each picture is authored once on a 16x16 design grid and scaled to the tile size, so the tile size is one constant.
2. **Mapping.** A second module, `repo/src/scene.js` (UMD, pure, no `window`/`document`/canvas), turns the view model from `view()` into a list of picture requests: `{x, y, picture, tone, ...}`. Tone is `full` (visible) or `dim` (remembered). It reads only the view model and returns new objects. It never mutates the view and never computes a mark. Marks (threat tint, reach border, letters, threat border, badges) keep being drawn by `page.js` from the same view fields as before.
3. **Remembered tiles and flame.** Both are made in code at draw time. Remembered tiles use the same drawing routine with a dimmed palette, derived from the fixed palette by one function (move toward grey, darken). Nothing is stored twice. The flame has five steps, one per r = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, taken from `v.radius` through a table in `scene.js`.
4. **Layering** follows D-003: terrain, item or brazier, area tint, reach mark, creature or player, threat border and badge. Creature and player pictures are always drawn at full tone.

Limits: this does not choose the look of any picture (Art Director, D-003 and `design/entity-pictures.md`). It changes no rule, mark or text output.

## Rationale

- Code drawing works from `file://` with no loading, no blocked resource and no canvas taint, and has no network. Criterion 47 is met by construction.
- The page already draws everything on a canvas, so no new technology is needed.
- A pure `scene.js` can be tested in Node. The mapping tables, the flame steps, the crouch pose and the "pictures change no mark" rule can be checked without a browser.
- `pictures.js` takes a ctx as an argument, so Node tests can run it with a recording fake ctx.
- Rules code (`game.js`, `light.js`, `view.js`) is not touched, so D-001 holds.

## Alternatives considered

- Separate PNG/SVG files drawn into the canvas: they work on `file://` for drawing only, may be blocked by stricter browser settings, and cannot be tested in Node. Rejected.
- Embedded base64 data: needs an authoring tool and a binary-looking blob nobody can review. Rejected.
- Inline SVG/DOM per tile: up to 680 elements to re-render each turn and a second render path next to the canvas marks. Rejected.
- Stored dimmed copies and stored flame sprites: more data to keep in sync, with no gain at this size. Rejected.
- Putting the mapping inside `page.js`: untestable in Node and it would mix picture choice with mark drawing. Rejected.

## Revisit when

Tiles prove too small for readable code-drawn pictures, a viewer finds the vector style too crude, or the project allows a build step or assets.
