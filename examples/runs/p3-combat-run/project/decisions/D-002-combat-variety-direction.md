# D-002: Fix combat monotony with encounter escalation first, then enemy behaviors that demand movement and the dash

## Decision

G-001 pursues **Option B, then Option A**, in two phases. Option C is held in reserve.

**Phase 1 (Option B: encounter design and escalation, existing enemies).**
- Escalate across the existing 5 rooms in enemy count, Grub/Spitter mix, spawn positions and Spitter placement.
- Use multi-side spawns and staggered waves so that a single corner or stance is not safe in later rooms.
- Optionally add one or two room-layout variants that make corners less safe.
- Stay inside the 5-room structure. Do not add rooms or lengthen the run.

**Phase 2 (Option A: new behaviors on the existing enemies).** In scope for G-001.
- Add 1–2 behavior variants built on the Grub and Spitter. Examples are a Grub with a telegraphed wind-up and lunge, which gives the dash a purpose, and a Spitter that repositions or fires a spread or faster shot.
- Every new behavior must show a clear telegraph before it can hurt (pillar 3).
- Phase 2 goes to build only after `technical-director` has assessed feasibility for the small team and `art-director` has given the telegraph visual direction. The Designer may specify Phase 2 behaviors, but they are marked "pending feasibility and telegraph review".

**Option C is not adopted now.** Reconsider a minimal form only if a playtest after Phases 1 and 2 still shows passivity. It must be one rule a player understands on sight and must not add combo vocabulary.

**Limits of this decision**
- No new input. D-001 is untouched. No pillar changes.
- The 5-room structure and the 15–20 min run target stay. Real-time run length has not been measured. The spec must not add content that lengthens the run, and the next playtest should record run time.
- This does not decide the mid-dash damage behavior. It is with `qa` (handoff 03). If it is a build defect, the Designer does not change the spec. If it is a spec gap, the Designer amends the spec.
- Exact numbers (counts, speeds, timings) are the Designer's to set in the spec. All timing must be frame-rate independent (correct at 30 and 60 FPS).

## Rationale

- Causes C1 (enemy behavior gives no reason to move) and C3 (no escalation or variety across rooms) explain all five symptoms. B addresses C3 and S4 cheaply with data and tuning on existing systems. A addresses C1 and C2, which is why one stance wins and why the dash has no purpose.
- Neither alone is enough. B alone risks "more of the same" with simple enemies, and A alone leaves rooms identical in structure.
- B first gives a quick, low-cost improvement and shows how much of the problem remains before the costlier A work. A is the answer to the root problem and fits the vision: depth through positioning, timing and enemy behavior.
- C risks drifting toward combo-style vocabulary, which the player profile dislikes, and has little to act on without A or B.
- No escalation trigger fires: no new button, no pillar change, no change to an Owner Decision, and the Goal's meaning is unchanged.

## Alternatives considered

- **A first, or A only:** higher cost and art/tech dependency up front, and rooms would stay structurally identical. Rejected as the starting point.
- **B only:** cheap, but does not fix the dash's lack of purpose (S3) or shallow enemies (S5).
- **C as a primary fix:** a supplement that depends on A or B and carries the combo-vocabulary risk. Deferred.
- **Extend run length or add rooms to get escalation:** conflicts with the short-runs pillar and is unmeasured. Rejected.

## Revisit when

- Playtests after Phase 1 show that the one-stance problem is already solved. Phase 2 could then shrink.
- `technical-director` finds the Phase 2 behaviors do not fit the small team. Rescope them.
- A measured run exceeds 20 minutes, or escalation cannot fit within 5 rooms.
- Passivity persists after both phases (reconsider C).
- Playtests show the depth ceiling cannot be reached without new input (D-001 "revisit" condition, an Owner matter).
