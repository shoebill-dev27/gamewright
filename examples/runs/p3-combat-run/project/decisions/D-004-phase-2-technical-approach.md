# D-004: Time-parametrized, sub-stepped lunge hit check; Fan Spitter over the repositioning Spitter; Phase 1 as one serial Build

## Decision

1. **Lunge motion and hit check.**
   - Lunge position is a function of elapsed time since a scheduled lunge-start timestamp on the accumulated game clock. It is not accumulated `velocity * dt`.
   - Each frame the Grub advances in sub-steps of at most about 0.25 tile (or a fraction of the smaller hitbox radius, if smaller), using the existing wall-stop movement and the existing overlap and contact test.
   - Each sub-step calls `isInvulnerable(t)` with that sub-step's time.
   - At most one hit per lunge.
   - Wind-up and lunge start on scheduled timestamps (wind-up start + 0.6 s), not on the frame that notices the expiry.
2. **Phase 2 Spitter variant: the Fan Spitter, not the repositioning Spitter.** It reuses the Spitter routine and projectile and needs no movement or pathing. The designer delegated the choice to the cheaper option.
3. **Phase 1 goes to Build as one serial task list with no separate Plan gate and no isolated workspace.** Build's first task reports current values (speeds, hearts, room size, spawner and marker support, hit-stun input behavior). If a spawner rework beyond a small scheduler is needed, it comes back to the technical-director.
4. **Gameplay numbers stay data** (timings, ranges, angles, counts), not code constants, so tuning needs no code change.

Not decided here: how the existing 0.2 s Flinch behaves for Phase 2 states. That is player-facing and goes to the game-designer (handoff 16, Open questions 1 and 2). The technical mechanism will be a per-state flinch-immune flag.

## Rationale

- The lunge moves 0.56 tile per frame at 30 FPS. A time-parametrized path with sub-stepping gives identical distance at 30 and 60 FPS and prevents tunneling, using only existing movement, overlap and invulnerability code.
- The Fan Spitter costs mostly data plus a charge and an aim lock. The repositioning Spitter needs wall selection and movement, and it interacts with the Phase 1 placement rules.
- Phase 1 tasks all touch the same spawner and enemy controller, so they cannot safely run in parallel. The risk is moderate and mostly about timers, which a test on the simulated clock covers.

## Alternatives considered

- **Analytic swept test (segment against hitbox) per frame:** exact and a little cheaper at run time, but it adds a new collision primitive, and wall-stop movement would still need separate handling. It can replace sub-stepping if profiling shows a need.
- **Per-frame velocity integration with an end-of-frame test:** tunnels at 30 FPS and differs between frame rates. Rejected.
- **Repositioning Spitter:** higher cost and more risk, less direct dash purpose. Rejected.
- **A separate Plan gate for Phase 1:** no benefit given the serial, low-risk task list. Rejected.
- **Parallel Phase 2 routines in isolated workspaces:** too small to be worth the merge risk on the shared flinch flag. Rejected.

## Revisit when

- Build's report shows Phase 1 needs more than a small scheduler.
- Profiling shows sub-stepping is too costly (use the analytic swept test).
- The designer changes the lunge speed or distance enough that the sub-step size no longer fits.
- The art-director's telegraph cost makes the Lunge Grub or Fan Spitter more expensive than assessed here.
