# Combat design (build 0.3)

## Player kit

- **Attack** (one button): a short swipe in the facing direction. 1 damage. 0.35 s recovery.
- **Dash**: 4 tiles over 0.25 s. The player is invulnerable for the full dash duration.
  Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends.
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, 0.3 s hit-stun (no input), then invulnerability until 0.8 s
  after the hit.

### Clarifications (G-001 spec, see `design/g001-combat-escalation.md`)

- **Invulnerability sources are independent.** Hit invulnerability (until 0.8 s after a hit) and dash
  invulnerability (the full dash duration) are separate timers. The player is invulnerable while
  either is active. A dash can start once hit-stun has ended, even while hit invulnerability is still
  running. A dash ending does not shorten remaining hit invulnerability. A hit cannot land during a
  dash, so hit-stun cannot begin during one.
- **Input during hit-stun is ignored, not buffered.** This covers dash and attack alike. See D-003.

## Enemies

| Enemy | HP | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Grub | 2 | Walks straight at the player; bites on contact (1 damage). No telegraph. |
| Spitter | 2 | Stationary; fires a slow projectile at the player every 2 s. |

Proposed Phase 2 variants (Lunge Grub, Fan Spitter) are described in `design/g001-combat-escalation.md`.
They are pending feasibility and telegraph review and are not part of the build until approved.

## Rooms

5 rooms, 3–7 enemies each, mixed Grubs and Spitters. A room ends when all enemies are defeated.
Per-room composition, spawn edges, waves, and Spitter placement are defined in
`design/g001-combat-escalation.md` (Phase 1).
