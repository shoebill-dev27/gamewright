- @need: instead of all other files, once: one path per line (up to 8 project or Studio files) to add to this packet before you route

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record with a route plan. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the latest Handoff, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps
4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and log why under
   *Route changes*. Confirm (`planned`) or drop (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition
   this result settles. The route is a plan, not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.3: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player kit of attack
and dash. Dry-run only: "running the build" means reading `sim/build-0.3.md`.

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).
- Dry-run project: there is no real repository. `sim/repo-notes.md` stands in for the code. A Build
  step implements a change by stating it exactly in its Handoff (what changes, where, and how to
  exercise it); the change then counts as made, and the runtime's simulator updates `sim/` from it.

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.

# G-001: Improve monotonous combat

## Owner request

> 戦闘が単調なので改善したい

## Interpretation

Success condition (qualitative): a player from the project's player profile experiences combat in the current build as varied and engaging rather than repetitive. Playing a run involves meaningful moment-to-moment variation in how the player positions, times and responds to enemies. Numeric thresholds belong to Design; the final verdict belongs to Review.

Constraints that shape any solution:
- Pillar 1 and D-001: combat stays one-button (attack + dash). No new input buttons without Owner approval. Variety must come from positioning, timing and enemy behavior.
- Readable threats (pillar 3) and 30/60 FPS correctness must be preserved.
- Small team: prefer reusing existing systems.

Out of scope: new input buttons or a larger player kit, changes to run length, new biomes or rooms unrelated to combat variety, and non-combat systems.

Not an immediate escalation: the Goal does not conflict with the vision or D-001. It must be solved inside them. If Diagnose finds that the only viable fixes need a new button or change a pillar, that triggers an Owner escalation then.

## Unknowns

Entry questions from `development-loop.md`:
- Observe: has the problem been observed first-hand? No. It is an experience problem (the game may work as specified but feel wrong), so `playtester` observes. The Owner's wording is not given to the Playtester, to avoid confirming a hypothesis.
- Diagnose: is the cause understood? No. What makes the combat feel monotonous is unknown (enemy behavior, kit depth, room design, pacing). Stage created.
- Decide: is there a real choice of direction, priority or scope? Yes. The diagnosis (handoff 04) offered three options (A: enemy behaviors, B: encounter design and escalation, C: rule rewards). Answered by D-002 (B first, then A; C in reserve).
- Design: is the intended behavior specified well enough to build? Not for the chosen direction. Planned (handoff 07).
- Plan: needed for Phase 2 (feasibility of new enemy behaviors, cost for a small team). Phase 1 is data/tuning; a Plan for it stays tentative.
- Build: the dash-damage defect fix (done, handoff 08), then Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the chosen direction.
- Verify: always after Build.
- Play: the Goal is about how the game feels, so a Playtester re-evaluates after each phase (fresh Handoff composed by the Studio without implementation history). It should record real-time run length.
- Review: experience Goal, so the Game Director judges the outcome. Planned.
- Observe (defect): the Playtester saw a possible dash-damage defect. QA confirmed it against `design/combat.md` (handoff 05). Intended behavior is already specified, so the fix needed no Design or Plan.

Skipped: none.

## Route changes

- After step 1 (Observe, playtester): the report matches the plan on the experience side (monotony confirmed: one winning approach in every room, little pressure to move, dash unused in combat), so Diagnose followed as planned. It also contained a possible defect (damage during a dash after being hit). Per the return rule "Play/Observe: defect → Observe (`qa`)", step 2b was added as a parallel step. Handoff 02 was edited in place (still from `playtester`) to add the Owner's report, mark the dash-defect item as routed to `qa`, and fill in Load and Expected output.
- After steps 2a and 2b: 2a produced a diagnosis with three options of different scope and cost (handoff 04), so Decide (`game-director`) followed. 2b confirmed a defect against specified behavior (handoff 05), so Build and Verify for the fix joined the route; no Design is needed because `design/combat.md` already specifies the behavior. QA's non-blocking question (how to treat a dash pressed during hit-stun) was left for `game-designer`.
- After steps 3a and 3b: 3a chose B then A with C in reserve (D-002, handoff 07); no escalation trigger fires, since everything stays within D-001 and the pillars. 3b delivered the invulnerability fix (handoff 08), which must be verified independently. Verify of the fix (4a) and Design of the chosen direction (4b) are independent (neither consumes the other's output), so they run as one parallel group; no other step is open. Handoff 09 for QA was composed by the Studio without the engineer's Sender assessment or root-cause reasoning. Handoff 07 was edited in place (still from `game-director`): its result is now addressed to `studio` so the Studio can route Phase 1 Build and the Phase 2 reviews; it also now records that the dash defect is confirmed and fixed pending verification, and passes on QA's open question about a dash during hit-stun. The Director's request for `technical-director` and `art-director` input on Phase 2 became rows 5a/5b, after the Design output exists. Phase 1 Build (6) waits for 4a so it does not stack on an unverified fix. Phase 2 build, verify and play were kept tentative, depending on the 5a/5b results. The earlier single Design row (5) is now 4b.

## Next action

One parallel group is open (4a, 4b):
- 4a: `qa` verifies the dash/hit invulnerability fix from `09-studio-to-qa.md` (skill `verify-change`), at 30 and 60 FPS, and returns a pass/fail report addressed to `studio`.
- 4b: `game-designer` writes the design spec from `07-game-director-to-game-designer.md` (skill `write-design-spec`), covering Phase 1 in full and Phase 2 as proposed behaviors, with the result addressed to `studio`.

After both finish, run Route again. If 4a fails, return to Build with the failure report; a second failure of the same criterion goes to `technical-director`. If 4b is done, open 5a and 5b in parallel (Phase 2 feasibility and telegraph visuals) and, once 4a has passed, Build Phase 1 (6).

## Outcome

(To be filled at close, in Japanese.)

# 10: qa → studio — Verification of the dash/hit invulnerability fix could not be done: the 0.3.1 build was not in the packet

## Task

Re-route the verification to QA with the build that is actually player-visible (`sim/build-0.3.1.md` or the latest `sim/build-*.md`). Verification is blocked, and no pass/fail verdict is given.

## Context

Goal G-001 (combat monotony). Handoff 09 asked QA to verify the 0.3 → 0.3.1 fix for "damage during a dash shortly after a hit" against the six acceptance criteria in `05-qa-to-studio.md`, at 30 and 60 FPS.

The Load list of handoff 09 names "the latest build under sim/ (`sim/build-*.md`)". No `sim/` file was supplied to this step. The inputs were:

- the handoff;
- the QA role and the `verify-change` skill;
- `design/combat.md`;
- project.md;
- D-001;
- handoff 05.

The role and skill require QA to observe behavior in the build, not to rely on the engineer's explanation. The only description of the change is the "What changed" text in handoff 09. That is a description of intent. It is not observed behavior, and it must not stand in for evidence. Passing or failing any criterion from it would be invented evidence.

## Findings

### Verdict

No verdict (`pass` or `fail`). Verification is **blocked** for lack of the build. Nothing was observed, so nothing is reported as passing.

### Per-criterion status (all from handoff 05)

| # | Criterion | 30 FPS | 60 FPS | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dash at the earliest moment (~0.3 s after the hit): no damage during the 0.25 s dash, at least 20 repeats, Grub contact or Spitter projectile | not verified | not verified | no build available |
| 2 | Dash presses at varied delays after the hit (including during hit-stun, and just before, at and after 0.8 s): no damage during an active dash | not verified | not verified | no build available |
| 3 | Different dash directions (towards and away from the source), rooms 1–5, Grubs and Spitters | not verified | not verified | no build available |
| 4 | Dash with no preceding hit: full 0.25 s invulnerability, no regression | not verified | not verified | no build available |
| 5 | Existing rules hold: hit-stun 0.3 s with no input, hit invulnerability to 0.8 s, dash cooldown 0.6 s, attack queued during a dash fires at its end | not verified | not verified | no build available |
| 6 | Previously mid-dash damage is not delayed to land right after the dash ends; damage after the windows expire is normal | not verified | not verified | no build available |

### Regressions checked

None. I could not check the flicker or sound cues that may have depended on the old shared invulnerability state, because there is no build to observe.

### Undefined-behavior cases

- A dash pressed during hit-stun (ignored or buffered) is unspecified in `design/combat.md`. Handoff 09 says the handling is unchanged. I could not observe it, so I have no observation to report. It stays an open, non-blocking question for `game-designer`, as already noted in handoff 05.
- Handoff 09 expects a one-frame difference for damage landing exactly on a 0.8 s or 0.25 s boundary (`now < expiry`). Once the build is available, I will record boundary results at 0.8 s and 0.85 s with the frame at 30 FPS (about 33 ms) and 60 FPS (about 17 ms) in view. The one-frame tolerance will not hide a failure of more than one frame.

### Plan once the build is available

1. Run the matrix from handoff 09 at 30 and 60 FPS. Use dash delays of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7, 0.79, 0.8 and 0.85 s after the hit. Keep a damage source present through the dash and until at least 0.8 s after the hit.
2. For each run, record whether damage landed:
   - during the dash;
   - between the dash end and 0.8 s after the hit;
   - after 0.8 s with no dash active.
3. Run the no-hit dash.
4. Cover both dash directions, rooms 1–5, and both enemy types.
5. Repeat the earliest-dash case at least 20 times per frame rate.
6. Check the cooldown, hit-stun, queued attack, and flicker/sound cues.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: Combat uses one attack button plus dash. No new input is involved.

## Constraints

- Verify from `design/combat.md`, the acceptance criteria and the build.
- Do not change the spec or the build.
- Must be verified at both 30 and 60 FPS.

## Open questions

- Please supply `sim/build-0.3.1.md` (the latest `sim/build-*.md`). Without it QA cannot verify the change.
- Non-blocking, for `game-designer`: how should a dash pressed during hit-stun be handled?

## Expected output

Studio re-routes to `qa` with the 0.3.1 build included in the Load. QA then returns a `pass` or `fail` verification report with per-criterion evidence at 30 and 60 FPS. If the build still cannot be supplied, Studio should say so and not count the fix as verified.

# 11: game-designer → studio — Send G-001 Phase 1 to Build and route the Phase 2 proposals for review

## Task

1. Send **Phase 1** (encounter escalation, data and tuning only) of `design/g001-combat-escalation.md` to Build.
2. Route the **Phase 2 proposals** (section 4 of that spec) to `technical-director` (feasibility and cost for a small team) and `art-director` (telegraph visuals, pillar 3). Phase 2 does not go to Build until both have answered.
3. After each phase is built, send it to Playtest and ask for real elapsed run time and per-room clear time.

## Context

Goal G-001: the Owner said 「戦闘が単調なので改善したい」. D-002 chose Option B (encounter escalation) then Option A (telegraphed behaviors), with C in reserve. This is the design spec requested in handoff 07.

## Findings

### What the spec contains
- **Phase 1** (build-ready): a 5-room table with counts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It adds second and third spawn edges, waves, a 0.8 s spawn marker, a 5-tile minimum spawn distance, and corner-covering Spitter placement from room 3. It changes room data only. Existing Grub and Spitter behavior is unchanged, except that a Spitter's first shot comes at least 1.0 s after it appears.
- **Phase 2** (proposed, pending review):
  - Lunge Grub: 0.6 s wind-up, then 5 tiles in 0.3 s, then 0.8 s recovery.
  - Fan Spitter: 0.6 s charge, then 3 projectiles at ±25°.
  - Both replace existing enemies in the room table, so the room totals stay the same.
- **Acceptance criteria**: six criteria, each mapped to a phase, with QA checks and experience signals (spec section 6).
  - P1: criteria 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the partial form of 2.
  - Phase 2 only: the full form of criterion 2, the lunge and fan telegraph checks in 4, and the P2 checks in 5.
- **Out of scope**: new input, extra rooms or longer runs, and Option C rules.

### Answers to the open questions from handoff 07
- **Layout variants**: not required for Phase 1. A 2×2 center block (spec 3.6) is held as a follow-up, to be added only if criterion 1 fails after Phase 1.
- **Behavior the current Grub cannot show**: possibly. Simultaneous two-side arrival depends on Grub speed relative to the 0.35 s attack recovery. Neither speed nor room size is in the design doc, so I could not confirm the pressure is real. **Build should report the current Grub speed, player speed, projectile speed, heart count and room size (in tiles).** Tuning knobs are listed in spec 3.5.
- **Dash during hit-stun**: ignored, not buffered (D-003).
- **Hit invulnerability and dash invulnerability**: independent timers; the player is invulnerable while either is active. This is a **spec clarification, applied to `design/combat.md`**. It does not change any specified behavior, and it does not touch the mid-dash damage fix (handoff 08), which restores the existing spec. QA's verification of that fix is unaffected.
- **Spec change worth noting**: the room enemy range in `combat.md` goes from 3–6 to 3–7, because room 5 has 7 enemies.

### Risks and what the evidence cannot settle
- All numbers are my choice, and most cannot be justified from a described walkthrough (spec section 7).
- Room 5 gets 7 enemies and the other rooms are also larger, which may lengthen the run. Real-time length is unmeasured. The fallback is to trim room 5 to 6 enemies.
- The spawn marker may need a new visual if no spawn effect exists. If so, `art-director` should review it.
- Lunge speed is about 0.55 tile per frame at 30 FPS, so the hit check must sweep along the path. This is for `technical-director`.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: one attack button plus dash. No new input.
- D-002: B then A, C in reserve, 5 rooms and 15–20 min run stay.
- D-003 (new): input during hit-stun is ignored, not buffered. Hit and dash invulnerability are independent timers.

## Constraints

- No new input and no pillar change. Neither is needed by this spec, so no Owner escalation.
- All timing is frame-rate independent (30 and 60 FPS).
- Phase 1 reuses existing systems, with data and tuning only.
- Phase 2 must not be built before `technical-director` and `art-director` have answered.

## Open questions

- `technical-director`: can the Lunge Grub (with a swept hit check) and the Fan Spitter, or the repositioning Spitter alternative, be built cheaply by this team? Which one should be dropped if cost is high?
- `art-director`: what telegraph visuals meet pillar 3 for the 0.6 s wind-up and the 0.6 s charge? Is there an existing spawn effect for the 0.8 s marker, or does it need a new one?
- Playtest after Phase 1: does a stationary stance still clear rooms 4–5? What is the real-time run length? Does passivity persist (which would reopen Option C)?

## Expected output

- **Build (Phase 1)**: implement the room data and the wave, marker and Spitter-delay rules in spec section 3 by stating the change exactly in its handoff (what changes, where, how to exercise it). Report the unknown values listed above. Then send it to QA against spec section 6 and to Playtest with the request to record real run time.
- **`technical-director` and `art-director`**: answers on Phase 2 go to `game-designer`, who adjusts the Phase 2 spec and hands it to the Studio for Build.

## Sender assessment

Confidence is medium-high that Phase 1 changes the one-stance result, because two-side arrival and a corner-covering Spitter directly break the corner stance. Confidence is lower on the exact numbers and on whether the current Grub speed makes two-side arrival hard enough. Phase 2 is intentionally unfinished until review. No escalation trigger applies.
