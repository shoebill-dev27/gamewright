## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 13: studio → qa — verify the level 1 opening change in build 0.3 against the 12 checks

## Task

Verify the level 1 change in build 0.3 against the 12 checks in `design/onboarding.md`. Judge pass or fail for each check from the spec and the build, and look for regressions in level 1 and in levels 2–3. Also complete the two items under Open questions.

## Context

Goal G-001. Owner request: 「最初のパズルで子どもが手を止めてしまう。直したい」. Children aged 7–10 stalled at the start of level 1 in build 0.2. A design change to the level 1 opening was specified in `design/onboarding.md` and D-002, and a new build, 0.3, contains it. Only level 1 should have changed. Levels 2 and 3 should behave as in 0.2. This is a dry-run project, so the build is read from `sim/build-0.3.md`.

## Findings

Nothing from the implementer is passed on. The acceptance criteria and the 12 checks are in `design/onboarding.md`, which is authoritative. Use the exercise hints below only as aids. If a hint differs from the spec, the spec wins and you note the difference.

Exercise hints (use a fresh level 1 load for each run; use a 60 fps screen recording where timing matters):

1. Load level 1, wait for the opening motion to finish, and capture the scene. Check which pieces look interactive.
2. Capture in grayscale and measure the contrast between the pool and the sand.
3. Inspect the crab, the home and all scenery in the capture for styling that wrongly signals interactivity.
4. Touch the crab, the home, the sand and the pool, 10 times each. Check for a visible response and its latency.
5. Press on the crab and drag. Observe what moves and what responds.
6. Tap the sand, the crab and the home rapidly for 5 s. Check how often the pool-side cue repeats and whether the touched objects still react.
7. Load and watch the opening motion without touching. On a new load, touch the pool during the motion.
8. Hide the text bubble and complete level 1 by touch only.
9. Confirm there is no failure, no timer and no countdown. Drag, drop and undo.
10. Check the sprites used in level 1 against the existing sprite sheet.
11. On three separate loads, touch the crab, then the home, then the sand during the opening motion. Check what happens and when. Also touch the pool during the settle-back that follows.
12. After each cancelled opening motion, and after an uncancelled one, drag, drop and undo. Check the resulting position and the number of undo steps.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: no failure, no timers, every move undoable.
- D-002: intro cancel eases the pool back; the intro is never in the undo history.
- The idle hint (Option C) is excluded from the spec. If the build contains any inactivity-triggered cue, report it as a failure against D-001.

## Constraints

- Phones and tablets, touch only; no mechanic may depend on reading text.
- Existing sprite sheet only.
- Level 1 only.

## Open questions

- Platform check: are iOS "Reduce Motion" and Android "Remove animations" available on the target platforms? Report what you can establish and how. A "not confirmable" result is acceptable. It does not block the verdict on the 12 checks, but state what a reduced-motion run shows if you can run one.
- The current styling of the home piece is not documented. Check 3 needs a real capture of it.

## Expected output

A pass/fail report with one verdict per check (1–12), the evidence (measured values, timings), and any regressions or new defects, each with severity. Set the overall `outcome` to `pass` only if all 12 checks pass. On a fail, name the failed criteria precisely. Address the report to `studio`, because the Studio composes the next handoff for the Playtester from permitted information only.

# Role: QA

## Responsibility

Reproduces defects and independently verifies that built changes meet their acceptance criteria
without breaking existing behavior.

## Decides

- Pass or fail against the acceptance criteria, with evidence.
- Whether a defect is reproducible, and its severity.

## Must not

- Modify the production code under verification. QA may add or run tests and test tooling.
- Redefine acceptance criteria, or pass a change with a known failing criterion.
- Decide intended behavior when the spec is silent — hand back to `game-designer`.

## Independence

Verify from the spec, the acceptance criteria and the build — not from the engineer's explanation
of why it should work. Prefer a fresh executor context without the implementation history.

## Works from

- For defects: the Owner's report and the relevant design documents.
- For verification: acceptance criteria, how to exercise the change, project constraints (e.g.,
  supported platforms and frame rates).
- Never the implementer's self-assessment or reasoning: a Handoff's `## Sender assessment` section
  is removed before QA receives it.

## Produces

- A defect report: reproduction steps, expected vs actual (with the source of "expected"),
  conditions, severity, acceptance criteria for the fix.
- A verification report: per-criterion pass/fail with evidence, regressions checked.

## Hands back / escalates when

- Verification fails → `gameplay-engineer`, with the failure report.
- The expected behavior is undefined → `game-designer`.
- The same criterion fails a second time → Studio routes to `technical-director`.

# Skill: Verify change

Typical roles: qa.

## When to use

After anything was built, before the work counts as done.

## Inputs

Acceptance criteria, how to exercise the change, project constraints (platforms, frame rates,
input devices), the defect report or spec the change answers.

## Method

1. Check each acceptance criterion independently, under every supported condition the criterion or
   the project constraints name. Record evidence per criterion.
2. Re-run the original reproduction steps for defects.
3. Check for regressions in neighbouring behavior the change could affect.
4. Verdict: `pass` only if every criterion passes. Otherwise `fail`, with the failing criterion,
   conditions and evidence. If a criterion cannot be judged because the expected behavior is
   undefined, report that as a spec gap.

## Output

Verification report: per-criterion result and evidence, conditions tested, regressions checked,
verdict.

## Do not

Modify the production code under test. Do not soften a failure into a pass with a note. Do not
rely on the implementer's explanation instead of observing behavior.

# Onboarding (build 0.2, level 1 spec targets the next build)

## Teaching plan

Teaching intent: each level introduces exactly one idea, discovered by touching. No level depends on reading text. Level 1 teaches "a tide pool can be dragged to the home" through look, motion and touch feedback only.

- **Level 1:** see the spec below.
- **Level 2:** two pools; the crab must pass through both. (Unchanged. Out of scope for G-001.)
- **Level 3:** introduces a starfish that only moves when a pool touches it. (Unchanged. Out of scope for G-001.)

## Level 1 spec (G-001, for the build after 0.2)

"Build 0.3" in the earlier header and "build 0.2" in Handoff 08 mean the same thing: the next build after 0.2, level 1 only (Q6).

### Experience intent

A child aged 7–10 looks at the scene and their eye goes to the pool. They touch it within a few seconds, drag it to the home and finish without reading anything. A touch on any other object never feels ignored: it answers and points the child back to the pool. Nothing can be lost, there are no timers, and every move can be undone (D-001).

### Scene content

The scene has one pool, one crab, one home and sand. It uses the existing sprite sheet only. Tint, recolor, scale, rotation, flip and brightness changes on existing sprites count as within the "no new art" constraint (confirmed). No hand, arrow or other new sprite is used.

### Rules and parameters

All numbers are tunable after re-playtest.

**1. Pool (the only draggable)**
- Outline: the same weight and darkness the crab has in build 0.2.
- Idle motion: a continuous scale pulse, 1.00 to 1.06, period 2.0 s, ease-in-out, looping. It never stops while the pool is idle.
- Color: recolor the pool to a more saturated pastel water blue/teal.
  - In grayscale, the luminance contrast ratio between the pool fill and the surrounding sand is at least 1.5:1.
  - Verify in grayscale, not by eye in color.
- Touch-down on the pool: the idle pulse stops, the pool scales to 1.10 within 0.1 s, and a soft shadow appears. On release it returns to scale 1.00 over 0.15 s and the idle pulse resumes.
  - If a redirect pulse is running at touch-down, the touch-down wins: the pulse is cancelled and the 1.10 lift applies from the current scale (Q5).
- Drag: the pool follows the finger 1:1. On release away from the home it stays where it was dropped, and undo restores the previous position (D-001).
- Drop on the home: the level completes (unchanged).

**2. Start-of-level intro motion (the non-text teaching cue)**
- When level 1 loads, the pool slides 25% of the distance toward the home over 0.8 s, then back over 0.8 s, once. The idle pulse starts after that.
- The motion is made only of position changes of the existing pool sprite.
- **Visual offset only (Q2).** The intro never pushes an undo history entry. The pool's logical position is the authored start position from load until a real drag is dropped. Undo after the first real drag returns the pool to the authored start position, never to a mid-intro position.
- **The pool's hit area follows its drawn position during the intro**, so a touch on the visible pool always grabs it.
- **Touch-down on the pool during the intro:** the intro is cancelled at once and the pool follows the finger from its current position. On release away from the home, the pool stays where it was dropped.
- **Touch-down on the crab, the home or the sand during the intro (Q1, Option B):**
  1. The intro is cancelled at once.
  2. The pool eases back to its authored start position over a fixed 0.15 s, ease-out, whatever its current distance. The idle pulse starts when the ease-back ends.
  3. The touched object's own response (crab wiggle, home glow) starts at once, within 0.1 s, and plays during the ease-back.
  4. The redirect pulse (rule 5) starts when the ease-back ends, which is 0.15 s after touch-down. This is inside the existing 0.2 s window, so the criterion does not change.
  5. If the child touches the pool during the ease-back, the ease-back is cancelled and the pool follows the finger from its current position.
  6. A touch that lands during the ease-back on another non-pool object plays that object's response. The redirect rate limit (rule 5) still applies.
- It plays once per level load, including a level restart.
- It is not tied to inactivity. There is no countdown, no repeat and no consequence. This is why it is not the idle hint (Option C), and it does not need a timer.

**3. Crab (responds to touch, not draggable, styling demoted)**
- Decision: the crab responds to touch. This is Option B and it removes the dead end. To keep the pool the only "touch me" signal, the crab's styling is demoted. This differs slightly from art-director direction 3, which allowed keeping the styling if the crab responds.
- Idle: no bob. The outline is lightened to the same weight as other scenery, so the crab does not look draggable. The pool is then the only element with a darker outline plus idle motion, which satisfies pillar 3.
- Tap: the crab turns to face the pool and wiggles (rotation ±8°, 0.4 s). The pool then gives a "look here" double pulse (see rule 5).
  - "Turns to face" (Q3): a horizontal flip (scale x of −1 or +1) of the existing sprite so it faces the side the pool is on, as seen from the crab's center, plus the wiggle. If the pool is on the same side the crab already faces, no flip. The flip is instant, and the wiggle starts at the same time.
- Drag attempt on the crab: the crab does not move from its place. It leans about 10° toward the pool while the finger is down and springs back on release. The pool gives one double pulse at touch-down.
- While the pool is being dragged, the crab keeps facing the pool.
- On level completion the crab goes to the home (existing behavior, unchanged).

**4. Home (responds to touch, not interactive)**
- Idle: no darker outline and no idle motion, the same as the sand and scenery. Build 0.2 does not show the home's styling. A capture is required, and any interactive styling found is removed.
- Tap: a soft brightness glow (+20% brightness for 0.6 s, fading out). The pool then gives a double pulse (rule 5).
- While the pool is dragged within 1.5 pool-widths of the home, the home glows steadily. This shows where the pool is meant to go. The glow ends when the pool moves away or on drop.
  - Distance (Q4): measured center to center, using the pool's at-rest width (not the pulsing or lifted size).
  - The glow applies only while the pool is being dragged. It never applies to a pool at rest, so the intro and its ease-back never trigger it.

**5. Redirect pulse ("look here")**
- Used by touches on the crab, the home and empty sand.
- The pool scales 1.00 to 1.15 and back, twice, over 0.6 s in total.
- It starts within 0.2 s of the touch-down. The visible response itself (crab wiggle, home glow) starts within 0.1 s. In the intro-cancel case the pulse starts at the end of the 0.15 s ease-back (rule 2).
- Rate limit: at most one redirect pulse per 1.5 s, so repeated tapping does not stack animations. The crab or home reaction still plays on every tap.
- A tap on empty sand triggers only the redirect pulse.
- A touch-down on the pool cancels a running redirect pulse (rule 1).

**6. Text bubble**
- It may stay as a supplement. No part of level 1 depends on it, and it is not changed in this spec.
- It must not carry information that is not also shown by the look and motion above.

### Edge cases

- **Multi-touch:** only the first touch that lands on the pool drags it. A second finger on the crab, home or sand gets its normal response. A second finger on the pool while it is already held is ignored.
- **Touch during the intro:** see rule 2 (pool touch, non-pool touch and touch during the ease-back are all defined).
- **Undo and the intro:** the intro is never in the history. Undo does not replay it and never returns to a mid-intro position (rule 2).
- **Pool dropped on the crab:** treated as a drop away from the home. The pool stays and the crab does not react. Nothing is lost, and undo works.
- **Pool dragged off screen:** the pool is clamped to the play area.
- **Touch on a moving or pulsing object:** hit areas are those of the sprite at rest, not the pulsing size, so the pulse does not change what counts as a hit. The one exception is the intro slide, where the pool's hit area follows its drawn position (rule 2).
- **Touch-down on the pool during a redirect pulse:** the touch-down wins (rule 1).
- **Level restart:** the intro plays again, because the level reloads.
- **Reduced-motion OS setting:** if it is on, the idle pulse, redirect pulse, wiggle and intro are replaced by static brightness changes of about 0.4 s.
  - The outline and the color/value separation still carry the affordance.
  - The intro is skipped, so the intro-cancel case does not arise.
  - The engineer reads the OS flag where it exists and adds no in-game toggle. The Studio handles the platform availability check outside Design. If a platform has no such setting, this case is unreachable there.
- **Orientation change:** layout and rules are unchanged, the intro does not replay, and the idle pulse continues.
- **Color-vision differences:** the pool is separated by value (grayscale check), not hue alone.

### Acceptance criteria

**Verification checks (for QA on the built level 1):**
1. A capture at level start (after the intro) shows the pool as the only element with a darker outline plus idle motion.
2. In grayscale, the pool fill and the sand have a luminance contrast ratio of at least 1.5:1.
3. The crab has no idle bob. The home has no interactive styling. No non-interactive element has an outline darker than scenery.
4. Touch-down on the crab, the home, the sand and the pool each produces a visible response within 0.2 s. Tapping each 10 times leaves no silent touches.
5. Dragging the crab does not move it. It leans and springs back, and the pool gives a redirect pulse.
6. The redirect pulse does not start more than once per 1.5 s of rapid tapping.
7. The intro runs once on level load. A touch-down on the pool cancels it, and the pool follows the finger from its current position.
8. Level 1 can be completed with the text bubble hidden.
9. D-001 holds: no failure state, no timer, and undo restores the pool position.
10. No sprite outside the existing sprite sheet is used.
11. Intro-cancel by a non-pool touch: touch the crab, the home and the sand in turn during the intro (separate loads). In each case the intro stops, the pool is back at its authored start position within 0.15 s, the touched object responds within 0.1 s, the redirect pulse starts no later than 0.2 s after touch-down, and the idle pulse then runs.
12. Undo after the intro: after any intro-cancel, drag the pool away and drop it, then undo. The pool returns to the authored start position, and no extra undo step exists for the intro.

**Experience signals (for the playtest and Review):**
Test with children aged 7–10, no adult help and no adult explanation. Include at least one early reader and one child who does not read the bubble.
1. The first touch-down on the pool comes within about 10 s of level start for every child. Baseline: the age 9 child needed 10 s with the bubble.
2. No pause longer than about 8 s with no touch interaction before the first pool drag. Looking to a parent for help counts as a pause.
3. A first touch on the crab or home leads to the pool within about 5 s, without parent help.
4. Children complete level 1 without reading aloud or being told what to do, and show no sign of "my touch did not work".

These numbers come from three simulated sessions and are tunable. If the re-playtest still shows a stall, raise the matter as an open question and hand back. See below.

### Plan or Build

This change is local. It covers parameters, a tint/recolor, existing sprite animations (scale, rotation, flip, position, brightness) and a per-object touch response in level 1. It touches no cross-system structure. **A Plan is not needed. The Studio can route Build.**

### Settled spec questions (Handoff 09)

- Q1: Option B with a fixed 0.15 s ease-back. The redirect pulse starts at the end of it. The 0.2 s criterion is unchanged (D-002).
- Q2: the intro is a visual offset only and never enters the undo history (D-002).
- Q3: horizontal flip plus wiggle (rule 3).
- Q4: center to center, at-rest width (rule 4).
- Q5: touch-down on the pool wins over a running redirect pulse (rule 1).
- Q6: "build 0.3" means the next build after 0.2, level 1 only.

### Open questions

- Whether the reduced-motion setting is available on target platforms (iOS "Reduce Motion", Android "Remove animations"). The Studio decides who checks it. It does not block Build.
- The home's current styling is not known from the packet. The engineer sets the scenery outline style and no idle animation. A real capture is needed at Verify (check 3).
- If the re-playtest still shows a stall, an idle hint (Option C) would need a Director reading of D-001. It is not in this spec and is not needed for it.
>>>END

<<<FILE sim/build-0.3.md
# Build 0.3: what running it looks like

Only level 1 differs from 0.2. Levels 2 and 3 look and respond exactly as in 0.2. Timings below are as seen in a 60 fps screen recording on a phone or tablet.

## Level 1 at rest (after the opening movement, about 1.6 s after load)

- The scene is sand, one tide pool, a crab and a shell-shaped home. The text bubble near the top still reads "Drag the tide pool!".
- The tide pool is a saturated pastel water blue/teal, clearly bluer and darker than the sand. In a grayscale capture its fill is visibly darker than the sand, at roughly 1.8:1 on the starting colors. The exact ratio depends on the sand's real color and on how the grayscale conversion is done.
- The tide pool is the only object with the darker outline. It pulses continuously and gently, growing from normal size to about 6% larger and back every 2 seconds.
- The crab has the same lighter outline as the other scenery. It no longer bobs and sits still.
- The shell home has the same lighter outline as the other scenery and does not move. Any highlight-style look it had in 0.2 is gone.
- Nothing else on screen has a darker outline than the scenery. There is no timer, countdown or failure message.

## Opening movement (once per load, and again after a restart)

- With no touch, the pool slides about a quarter of the way toward the home over 0.8 s, then slides back over 0.8 s. The idle pulse then starts at the pool's starting spot.
- It does not replay when the device is rotated, and the pulse carries on through the rotation.
- During the slide, the pool can be grabbed where it is drawn.

## Touching the pool

- On touch-down, any opening movement, ease-back or redirect pulse stops at once. The pool grows to about 10% bigger within 0.1 s and a soft shadow appears under it. The idle pulse stops.
- The pool follows the finger 1:1 from where it was drawn, including mid-slide, and cannot leave the play area.
- A second finger placed on a pool that is already held is ignored.
- On release the pool shrinks back to normal size over 0.15 s, the shadow goes, and the idle pulse resumes. The pool stays where it was dropped.
- Dropping on the home finishes the level. Dropping on the crab leaves the pool there, and the crab does not react.
- The touchable area is the pool's normal size. While it pulses larger, a touch on its outer rim can count as a touch on the sand underneath and give the sand response instead.
- Undo after a drop puts the pool back at its previous position. After the first drop, that is the starting spot, not any spot from the opening movement. A second undo does nothing.

## Touching the crab

- Within 0.1 s the crab flips instantly, if needed, to face the side the pool is on, judged from the crab's center. If it already faces that side, it does not flip. It wiggles about ±8° for 0.4 s.
- The pool then does a pulse: it grows to about 15% bigger and back twice, over 0.6 s in total. It starts within 0.2 s of the touch.
- If the finger stays down and moves, the crab does not move. It leans about 10° toward the pool while the finger is down and springs back on release. Only one pool pulse happens, at touch-down.
- While the pool is being dragged, the crab flips to face it whenever the pool crosses to the other side of the crab's center. These flips are instant.

## Touching the home

- Within 0.1 s the home brightens by about 20% and fades back over 0.6 s. The pool does the same pulse as above.
- The home does not move and cannot be dragged.

## Touching empty sand

- Only the pool pulse happens. The sand itself shows nothing.

## Repeated touches

- The pool pulse starts at most once every 1.5 s. Tapping the sand, crab and home quickly for 5 s gives the pool about three or four pulses.
- The crab wiggle and flip, and the home glow, still play on every tap.
- Every touch on the crab, home, sand or pool shows some visible response within 0.2 s.

## Home glow while dragging

- While the pool is held, the home glows steadily whenever the pool's center is within 1.5 pool-widths of the home's center. The width is the pool's normal size, not its enlarged or lifted size.
- The glow ends when the pool moves out of range or is dropped. A pool that is not held never triggers it, including during the opening movement.

## Touching something other than the pool during the opening movement

- The opening movement stops. The pool glides back to its starting spot in 0.15 s, however far along the slide it was.
- The crab flip and wiggle, or the home glow, start at once and play during that glide. For sand there is no object response.
- At 0.15 s the pool lands at its starting spot, the pool pulse starts, if the 1.5 s limit allows, and the idle pulse begins.
- Touching the crab, home or sand during the glide plays that object's response. The glide carries on.
- Touching the pool during the glide makes it follow the finger from where it is drawn.
- After a drop, undo returns the pool to its starting spot, and a second undo does nothing. This is the same whether or not the opening movement was cut short.

## Devices with a reduce-motion setting turned on

- This applies to iOS "Reduce Motion" and Android "Remove animations", where those settings exist. Level 1 checks the setting when it loads.
- The opening movement is skipped.
- The idle pulse, pool pulse, crab wiggle and crab lean are replaced by plain brightness changes lasting about 0.4 s. The crab and the home do not move.
- The darker outline and the color difference between the pool and the sand are still there.
- The pool still grows, gets a shadow, follows the finger and shrinks on release as described above.
- The crab still flips instantly to face the pool.
- On devices without this setting, the full movement above is shown. There is no in-game switch.

## Other

- The level is still finished by dragging the pool onto the home. It can be done by touch alone, with the text bubble hidden or ignored.
- All artwork comes from the existing sprite sheet, with only color, flip, size, rotation, position and brightness changes.
>>>END

<<<FILE project.md#constraints
## Constraints

- Phones and tablets, touch only.
- No ads, no in-app purchases.
- No mechanic may depend on reading text.
- Small art budget: reuse the existing sprite sheet where possible.
- Dry-run project: there is no real repository. `sim/repo-notes.md` stands in for the code. A Build
  step implements a change by stating it exactly in its Handoff (what changes, where, and how to
  exercise it); the change then counts as made, and the runtime's simulator updates `sim/` from it.

# D-001: No fail states and no timers

## Decision

The game has no way to lose, no timers, and every move can be undone.

## Rationale

The audience is young children; the Owner wants play to feel safe and unhurried.

## Alternatives considered

- Move limits with stars: common in the genre, but introduces failure and pressure.

## Revisit when

Never without the Owner; this is a pillar.

# D-002: Intro cancel eases the pool back; the intro is never in undo history

## Decision

- A touch-down on the crab, the home or the sand during the level 1 intro cancels the intro. The pool eases back to its authored start position over a fixed 0.15 s, and the idle pulse starts there. The touched object responds at once. The redirect pulse starts when the ease-back ends.
- A touch-down on the pool during the intro cancels it, and the pool follows the finger from its current position.
- The intro is a visual offset only. It never pushes an undo history entry. The pool's logical position is the authored start until a real drag is dropped, and undo returns to that.

Limits: level 1 only. It does not add a timer or an irreversible step (D-001).

## Rationale

- Children are likely to tap the crab first, and the case will occur in the re-playtest. Option B makes every child see the same scene afterwards, with the pool at its authored place and pulsing.
- A fixed 0.15 s ease-back keeps the pulse inside the existing "within 0.2 s" criterion. The acceptance criteria stay unchanged and no case needs an exception.
- Keeping the intro out of the history means undo is predictable and does not depend on when the child touched.

## Alternatives considered

- Option A (pool stays mid-slide): simpler, but the pool rests off its authored position and the first undo state would be ambiguous.
- Option C (ignore non-pool touches during the intro): contradicts "every touch gets a visible response within 0.2 s".
- A 0.2 s ease-back with the pulse after it (the engineer's proposal): it would stretch the pulse window to 0.2 s after the ease-back and change the criterion for no benefit.

## Revisit when

The re-playtest shows children confused by the pool snapping back, or the intro is changed in length or distance.

<!-- Self-contained: the recipient (any executor, any session) starts from this file and its Load
list alone. The sender fills Task through Open questions and drafts Expected output; the Studio
checks it against the recipient's "Works from", settles Expected output and fills Load when routing.
outcome: routed = written by the Studio; done = work finished, no verdict; pass/fail = verification
verdict; question = handed back with an open question; goal-met/goal-not-met = Review verdict.
Paths: studio/... is relative to the Studio root; everything else to the Project Context directory.

Previous handoff = the Handoff the sender worked from (one step of history). -->

## Task

<What the recipient must do, in one or two sentences.>

## Context

<Why this work exists: the Goal and what happened so far, briefly.>

## Findings

<What the sender found or produced. For a Playtester recipient: nothing about implementation.>

## Decisions already made

<D-NNN links and one-line summaries, or "None".>

## Constraints

<Limits the recipient must respect.>

## Open questions

<Questions the recipient must answer or route, or "None".>

## Expected output

<What the recipient produces and where it goes next.>

## Sender assessment

<Optional. The sender's own evaluation and reasoning: self-test verdicts, root cause analysis,
confidence. Kept for the record and for Roles that may use it; removed before the Handoff reaches
a Role whose policy strips it (qa, playtester).>

## Load

- Role: studio/roles/<role-id>.md
- Skills: studio/skills/<skill-id>.md
- Project: <only the project files this step needs: project.md sections (project.md#section),
  design documents, the build>
- Decisions: <decisions/D-NNN-...md, or none>
- Previous handoff: <goals/G-NNN-.../NN-...md, or none>
