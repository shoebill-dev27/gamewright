# Studio operation packet

operation: Route
goal: G-001
step_artifacts: goals/G-001-first-puzzle-stall/24-qa-to-studio.md
next_seq: 25
context_request: allowed once (@need, up to 8 paths)
current_build: sim/build-0.4.md (newest simulated build; older ones are history)
log: last 5 of 11 entries in @log-recent; the full history is goals/G-001-first-puzzle-stall/log.md

## You may write

- goals/G-001-first-puzzle-stall/goal.md
- goals/G-001-first-puzzle-stall/24-qa-to-studio.md (in place: keep kind, goal, seq, from, to and any Sender assessment)
- goals/G-001-first-puzzle-stall/NN-studio-to-<role or owner>.md: up to 3 new artifacts, consecutive NN starting at 25
- @need: instead of all other files, once: a file block `<<<FILE @need` with one path per line (up to 8 project or Studio files), then `>>>END`, to add them to this packet before you route

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# Studio

The tool-neutral definition of the Studio. Nothing in this directory names a specific AI tool,
model, or game project. Any executor — an AI agent session of any kind, or a human — reads these
files to do the work. Canonical intent: `docs/spec/initial-spec.md`.

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | The human. Gives Goals, decides Owner-level questions. | — |
| Studio | The orchestration function. Turns a Goal into routed Steps. Owns process (who works next, on what), never game content. | `orchestration.md` |
| Goal | An Owner request, tracked as a Goal record with a route plan. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/goal.md` |
| Step | One unit of work by one Role, started from one incoming Handoff. | — |
| Role | A responsibility with authority and boundaries. Not a model, not an agent. | `roles/` |
| Skill | A method for doing a kind of work. Usable by any Role whose responsibility covers that work. | `skills/` |
| Workflow | The catalogue of development stages plus routing rules. A menu, not a pipeline. | `workflows/development-loop.md` |
| Isolated execution | How a runtime runs each operation in a fresh executor that sees only its packet, and enforces Role policies. | `execution.md` |
| Project Context | Everything specific to one game: vision, state, constraints, design, decisions, goals. | outside `studio/` |
| Handoff | Persisted work packet between Steps. Self-contained: a new executor can start from it alone. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*.md` |
| Decision | Persisted significant judgment: what, why, alternatives, when to revisit. | `<project>/decisions/` |
| Escalation | Persisted request for an Owner decision, with options and a recommendation. | `<project>/goals/<goal>/NN-*-to-owner.md` |
| Executor | Whatever runs a Step. Chosen at run time. Never named in Role, Skill or Workflow definitions. | — |

Separation rules:

- **Role ≠ Executor.** Any executor can run any Role. Changing executors changes nothing here.
- **Role ≠ Skill.** A Role says who is responsible; a Skill says how the work is done. Role
  contracts list *typical* skills only; a Role may use any Skill its responsibility covers.
- **Role ≠ Project.** Roles and Skills contain no game-specific facts. Project facts arrive through
  the Handoff's Load list.
- **Studio ≠ Game Director.** The Studio routes; the Game Director judges the game. A Goal that needs
  no direction decision never passes through the Game Director.

## Roles

| id | Responsible for |
|---|---|
| `game-director` | Overall direction, priorities, important decisions; guarding the vision; judging whether experience goals are met. |
| `game-designer` | Turning intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified well enough to build and verify. |
| `technical-director` | Turning approved specs into feasible technical plans; technical risk, architecture, sequencing, parallelization. |
| `gameplay-engineer` | Implementing approved designs and plans, and fixing defects. |
| `art-director` | Visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, clarity of what the player sees. |
| `qa` | Reproducing defects and independently verifying built changes against acceptance criteria. |
| `playtester` | Evaluating the game as a player, from observable experience only. |

Participants that are not Roles: `studio` (routing) and `owner` (the human).

## Skills

| id | Method for | Typical roles |
|---|---|---|
| `reproduce-defect` | Reproducing a reported problem and writing a precise defect report with acceptance criteria. | qa |
| `verify-change` | Verifying a change against acceptance criteria and checking for regressions. | qa |
| `playtest-session` | Playing a build as a player and reporting observable experience. | playtester |
| `diagnose-experience` | Turning experience observations into causes and solution options in design terms. | game-designer, game-director |
| `write-design-spec` | Specifying player-facing behavior, parameters and player-observable acceptance criteria. | game-designer, art-director |
| `technical-plan` | Turning an approved spec into an implementation plan with risks, tests and sequencing. | technical-director |
| `implement-change` | Changing the game per spec and plan, with tests; stopping on ambiguity. | gameplay-engineer |
| `make-decision` | Choosing between options within one's authority and recording the Decision. | game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director |
| `prepare-owner-escalation` | Framing an Owner-level question as options, reasoning and a recommendation. | game-director, technical-director |
| `visual-review` | Reviewing what the player sees for readability and consistency with the art direction. | art-director |
| `review-outcome` | Judging whether a Goal's intent was met and naming the next issues. | game-director |

## Context loading

Never load every Role, Skill or document. A Step loads exactly what its incoming Handoff lists
under **Load** (spec §17):

```text
Current Role + Required Skills + Current Task (the Handoff)
+ Relevant Project Context + Relevant Decisions + Previous Handoff
```

The Studio's own routing operations load the files named in `orchestration.md`. This README is the
catalogue the Studio uses to choose Roles and Skills without opening every file.

## Project Context layout

A Project Context is a directory. It may live inside the game repository (keeps decisions versioned
with the game) or anywhere else; the Studio is given its path.

```text
<project>/
├── project.md            # vision, player profile, current state, constraints, design index (templates/project.md)
├── design/               # relevant design documents
├── decisions/            # D-NNN-<slug>.md (templates/decision.md)
└── goals/
    └── G-NNN-<slug>/
        ├── goal.md       # Goal record and route plan (templates/goal.md)
        └── NN-<from>-to-<to>.md   # Handoffs and Escalations, in order
```

Path convention inside Project artifacts: paths starting with `studio/` are relative to the Studio
root; all other paths are relative to the Project Context directory. `file#section` names one `## `
section by its slug: the heading in lowercase with spaces as hyphens (`project.md#current-state`).
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/orchestration.md
# Studio Orchestration

The Studio receives an Owner Goal and moves it forward until the Goal is met or the next decision
belongs to the Owner (spec §13).

The Studio decides **process**: which Role works next, with which Skills, on which context, in what
order. It never decides game content, specs, technical approach or verification verdicts — those
belong to Roles (see Decision authority). Choosing only the stages a Goal needs is the Studio's
core job; adding stages is not.

## Operations

Every executor performs these operations the same way. In Phase 1 a human starts each operation;
the Studio stops after Intake and after every Route, and states the next action (spec §18).
`execution.md` defines how a runtime runs each operation in a fresh, isolated executor that sees
only its packet; the procedures below are the same either way.

`goal.md` holds the Goal's current state; its history is the **Goal log**, `log.md` in the
Goal's directory. After every Intake, Route and Resume, whoever runs the operation appends one
entry (an isolated runtime does it itself): the operation and date, the Goal's status and open
steps, and the *Route changes* text just written. Entries are never edited or removed, and no Role
or Studio operation rewrites the log. Every operation keeps *Owner request* exactly as quoted at
Intake. Only Resume, after an Owner decision, may change *Interpretation*; a Route that would need
to reinterpret the Goal escalates instead.

### Intake — a new Goal

Load: `studio/README.md`, this file, `studio/workflows/development-loop.md`, `<project>/project.md`,
and the titles of `<project>/decisions/`. Open a design document or Decision only if the Goal
touches it.

1. **Understand the Goal.** Quote the Owner's words verbatim. Restate the Goal as an observable
   success condition, qualitatively; numeric thresholds belong to Design (acceptance criteria) and
   the final verdict to Review. Note what is out of scope.
2. **Check the Project Context.** Vision, current state, constraints, and Decisions the Goal touches.
3. **Check for an immediate escalation.** If acting on the Goal requires reinterpreting it, or it
   conflicts with the vision or a Decision, escalate before routing (see Escalation).
4. **List the unknowns.** Ask each stage's entry question in `development-loop.md`. Every question
   that cannot be answered from the Project Context is an unknown.
5. **Select stages, Roles and Skills.** One stage per unknown, plus Verify after any Build. The Role
   is whoever holds authority over that question; the Skills come from the stage table. Mark each
   stage `planned` (needed whatever earlier steps find), `tentative` (needed only if an earlier
   step's result calls for it — say which result), or `skipped` (the Project Context already
   answers its question — say how).
6. **Order and parallelize.** Default is sequential. Parallel only for independent steps (see
   Parallel work).
7. **Write** `goals/G-NNN-<slug>/goal.md` (templates/goal.md; next free number in the project,
   short kebab-case slug, ISO dates) and the first Handoff `01-studio-to-<role>.md`; mark that
   first step `open` in the route table. Apply Route
   steps 4–5 to that Handoff: read the recipient's Role contract ("Works from", "Independence")
   before writing it.
8. **Return to the Owner** and stop: the route, why each stage is there, which stages were skipped
   or left tentative and why, and the next action.

### Step — run the next step

Load exactly the incoming Handoff, the files in its **Load** list, and the template of the artifact
you write (`studio/templates/`). Nothing else. `file#section` means that section only; scanning the
file's headings to find it is fine.

1. Act as the receiving Role: respect its contract (Decides / Must not), follow the listed Skills.
2. Produce the Expected output.
3. Write the outgoing Handoff (templates/handoff.md), filling Task through Open questions from your
   own work. Your output (report, diagnosis, plan, verdict) goes in Findings, or in the project
   files Findings names (e.g., a design document). Set `outcome`, and set `to` to the next Role
   per the route — or per your Role contract's "Hands back / escalates when" if your result calls
   for it. If the incoming Handoff's Expected output names another recipient (e.g., `studio`),
   use that.
4. Do not route around your contract: if the work needs a decision you do not hold, hand back.

### Route — after every step

Load: `goal.md`, the last few entries of the Goal log, the latest Handoff, this file,
`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`; for steps 4–5 also the recipient's Role contract and the
files you put in its Load list.

1. Mark the step done in the route table, linking its Handoff.
2. **Compare the outcome with the plan.** If it fits, the next planned step follows. If not, apply
   the return rules in `development-loop.md`, revise the remaining route, and say why under
   *Route changes* in one to three lines (600 characters at most), replacing the previous text
   (the Goal log keeps the history; the Handoffs carry the details). Confirm (`planned`) or drop
   (`skipped`) any `tentative` stage whose condition this result settles. The route is a plan,
   not a contract.
3. **Check escalation triggers** (below). If one fires, write an Escalation instead of a Handoff.
4. **Check the recipient's inputs.** Compare the outgoing Handoff with the recipient Role's
   "Works from" section; remove what the recipient must not receive and add what is missing,
   editing the Handoff in place (it keeps `from`: the sender). Leave `## Sender assessment`
   untouched: it stays on record, and Roles whose policy strips it never receive it.
   When the recipient has an Independence section that forbids what the sender knows (e.g., a
   Playtester after Build or Verify), the Studio composes a fresh Handoff for the recipient from
   permitted information only. To make that possible, the Handoff that routes work to the sender
   says in its Expected output: address the result to `studio`.
5. **Select context.** Fill the Handoff's Load list: the recipient's Role contract, its Skills, the
   Project Context sections and Decisions this step needs, and the previous Handoff. You choose
   files by name (the project file list); you do not need to read a file to list it — the recipient
   reads it. Never route a step to `studio` itself: the open step is always a Role's or the Owner's.
   When opening parallel steps, write one Handoff per step in the same Route (consecutive `seq`).
   If you truly cannot route without reading an artifact's content, an isolated runtime lets you
   request specific files once (`execution.md`, context request).
6. **Mark the next step `open`** in the route table, with the Handoff that starts it, and update
   Next action in `goal.md`. If the Goal is met, Close.

### Resume — after an Owner decision

1. Record the Owner's choice as a Decision with `decided_by: owner` (templates/decision.md),
   including the Owner's own words and any conditions they added.
2. Set the Escalation to `status: resolved` with `decision: D-NNN`; set the Goal back to `active`.
3. Re-plan the remaining route from the Escalation's "If chosen" consequences for the chosen option.
   If the Owner chose something no option described, re-run Intake steps 4–6 on the remaining work.
4. Write the next Handoff with `from: studio`, citing the Decision under *Decisions already made*.

### Close

Fill the Goal record's **Outcome** for the Owner: results, Decisions made, next issues (proposed
new Goals), and items needing the Owner. Set `status: done` (or `abandoned`, with the reason).

Owner-facing text — the Outcome, Escalation briefs, and the Studio's replies to the Owner — uses
the project's `owner_language`. Other artifacts use whatever language the project's executors
share.

## Escalation

The Studio does not finalize every judgment on its own (spec §5, §19).

### Escalate to the Owner when

- the game's core concept, a vision pillar, or an Owner-made Decision would change;
- several major directions are viable and the evidence does not settle which;
- scope, cost or risk would change significantly beyond what the Goal implies;
- the Owner's taste or values are the main criterion for the choice;
- the change is irreversible (destructive data or asset changes, releases, public commitments);
- the Goal itself has to be reinterpreted to make progress;
- the work is blocked on information or material that no Role can produce (e.g., reproduction
  details only the Owner has, a build or repository that does not exist). The brief says exactly
  what is needed and why no Role can produce it; options include providing it, narrowing the Goal,
  or stopping.

### Do not escalate

Choices inside a Role's authority that stay within the vision, the constraints and existing
Decisions. The responsible Role decides and, if significant, records a Decision. Escalating these
pushes work back onto the Owner that the Studio exists to absorb.

### How to escalate

1. The Role with authority nearest the question prepares the brief with `prepare-owner-escalation`
   (usually `game-director`; `technical-director` for technical risk or irreversibility).
2. The brief is an Escalation file (templates/escalation.md): options, consequences, a Studio
   recommendation, reasoning, and what happens next under each option.
3. The Studio sets the Goal to `blocked-on-owner`, pauses every step that depends on the answer
   (independent steps may continue), and returns the brief to the Owner.

## Decision authority

Final decisions belong to the responsible Role — never to a vote across executors or opinions
(spec §14).

| Question | Decides |
|---|---|
| Direction, priorities, which approach to pursue within the vision, scope within a Goal, whether an experience Goal is met | `game-director` |
| Rules, systems, tuning, player-facing behavior within the approved direction | `game-designer` |
| Technical approach, architecture, sequencing, parallelization | `technical-director` |
| Implementation details within the spec and plan; root cause of a defect | `gameplay-engineer` |
| Visual direction and consistency within the vision | `art-director` |
| Pass/fail against acceptance criteria; reproducibility and severity | `qa` |
| Accuracy of experience observations (no decision authority over the game) | `playtester` |
| Routing and process | `studio` |
| Anything matching an escalation trigger | `owner` |

Record a Decision when it constrains work beyond the current step, when a real alternative was
rejected, or when the Owner made it. Smaller choices are noted in the Handoff.

## Parallel work, workspaces and sub-executors

- **Parallel steps** only when neither consumes the other's output (e.g., QA verification and an
  Art Director visual review of the same build). Each gets its own Handoff (consecutive `seq`).
  Steps open at the same time are parallel; label their rows as you like (e.g., 2a, 2b). The Route
  operation waits for all of them before moving on.
- **Isolated code workspaces** (e.g., separate working trees) only when independent code changes
  run in parallel, as decided in a Technical Director plan. Never to separate Roles (spec §15).
- **Sub-executors** may do specialist research or independent review for a Role. They report to
  that Role; the Role decides.
- **Independence.** Run `qa` and `playtester` steps in a fresh executor context without the
  implementation history, whenever the executor makes that possible.

## Loop limits

No unbounded loops (Phase 1 has no autonomous loop at all, but routes can cycle):

- The same acceptance criterion fails verification twice → route to `technical-director` to
  re-plan, not to a third fix attempt.
- A Goal re-enters Diagnose twice without measurable progress → `game-director` reviews; this may
  become an escalation about scope or the Goal itself.
- A step hands back `question` twice for the same missing input, with nothing new supplied in
  between → do not route it to a Role again; escalate to the Owner for that input.
>>>END

<<<FILE studio/workflows/development-loop.md
# Development Loop

The standard loop (spec §12):

```text
Observe → Diagnose → Decide → Design → Plan → Build → Verify → Play → Review → Next
```

It is a **menu of stages, not a pipeline.** A stage enters a route only when its entry question is
open for this Goal. Most Goals use a few stages; only a Goal where everything is unknown uses all.

## Stages

| Stage | Include when… | Responsible role | Skills | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Observe | the problem has not been reproduced or observed first-hand | `qa` for defects; `playtester` for experience | `reproduce-defect` / `playtest-session` | defect report / observation report |
| Diagnose | the cause is not understood | `game-designer` for experience and rules; `technical-director` for technical causes; add `art-director` when the cause may be visual | `diagnose-experience` / `technical-plan` / `visual-review` | diagnosis with options |
| Decide | there is a real choice of direction, priority or scope | `game-director` (the Owner if an escalation trigger fires) | `make-decision`, `prepare-owner-escalation` | Decision or Escalation |
| Design | intended player-facing behavior is not specified well enough to build and verify | `game-designer`; `art-director` for what the player sees | `write-design-spec` | spec with player-observable acceptance criteria |
| Plan | the technical approach is non-obvious, risky, cross-system, or could be parallelized | `technical-director` | `technical-plan` | plan |
| Build | the game must change | `gameplay-engineer` | `implement-change` | change and build notes |
| Verify | anything was built — always after Build | `qa`; add `art-director` in parallel when the change affects visuals | `verify-change` / `visual-review` | pass/fail report |
| Play | the Goal is about how the game plays or feels | `playtester` | `playtest-session` | observation report |
| Review | the Goal is an experience Goal or involved a direction Decision | `game-director` | `review-outcome` | goal met or not, next issues |
| Next | always, at the end | `studio` | — | Outcome for the Owner (orchestration.md, Close) |

**Defect or experience problem?** A defect is behavior that contradicts the design documents or
Decisions, or is plainly broken (crash, stuck state, lost progress): Observe with `qa`. An
experience problem is behavior that works as specified but plays or feels wrong: Observe with
`playtester`. If unsure, start with `playtester`; defects it finds go to `qa` (return rules).

Answering an entry question from the Project Context removes the stage. Examples: a defect whose
intended behavior is already in the design documents needs no Design; a fix whose approach is
local and obvious needs no Plan; a defect needs no Play or Review.

## Return rules

When a step's outcome does not fit the plan, route by the first matching rule.

| From | Outcome | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| any | an escalation trigger fires | Owner escalation (orchestration.md) |
| Verify | fail: built behavior differs from the acceptance criteria | Build (`gameplay-engineer`) with the failure report |
| Verify | fail on the same criterion a second time | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Verify | the expected behavior is undefined | Design (`game-designer`) |
| Build | spec ambiguous, contradictory or missing a case | Design (`game-designer`), then back to Build. The engineer does not decide. |
| Build | plan not workable | Plan (`technical-director`) |
| Build, Plan | conflicts with the approved direction or the Goal's scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Plan | spec infeasible within constraints | Design (`game-designer`); Decide (`game-director`) if scope must change |
| Design | needs a choice of direction, priority or scope | Decide (`game-director`) |
| Play | design or experience issue | Diagnose (`game-designer`); `game-director` when it implies a direction or priority change |
| Play | defect | Observe (`qa`) |
| Review | goal not met | Diagnose again, with the Review's findings |
| Review | goal met | Next; new issues become proposed Goals, not scope growth |

## Route patterns

Precedents to start from, not templates to force. Always derive the route from the unknowns.

1. **Reproducible defect, intended behavior specified:**
   Observe (`qa`) → Build (`gameplay-engineer`) → Verify (`qa`).
2. **Experience problem, cause unknown:**
   Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer`) → Decide (`game-director`) → Design
   (`game-designer`) → Plan (`technical-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa`) → Play (`playtester`) →
   Review (`game-director`).
3. **Specified feature in an approved direction:** Plan (if needed) → Build → Verify
   (→ Play and Review if it has an experience target).
4. **Visual readability problem:** Observe (`playtester`) → Diagnose (`game-designer` with
   `art-director`) → Design (`art-director`) → Build → Verify (`qa` ∥ `art-director`) → Play.
5. **Question only, no change wanted:** Observe and/or Diagnose → Next with findings.

# Project: Tidepool Garden (sample)

## Vision

A calm touch puzzle game for children and families: slide tide pools to guide sea creatures home.
Pillars:

1. **No failure, no timers.** Nothing is ever lost; any move can be undone (D-001).
2. **Learn by touching.** Players discover rules by interacting, not by reading.
3. **Soft and warm**, but interactive pieces always stand out clearly.

## Player profile

Children aged 7–10, some still early readers, often playing beside a parent. Short sessions
(5–15 minutes). Quickly lose interest when nothing responds to their touch.

## Current state

Prototype build 0.2: 12 levels. Level 1 teaches dragging with a text bubble ("Drag the tide pool!").
Dry-run only: "running the build" means reading `sim/build-0.2.md`.

## Constraints

- Phones and tablets, touch only.
- No ads, no in-app purchases.
- No mechanic may depend on reading text.
- Small art budget: reuse the existing sprite sheet where possible.
- Dry-run project: there is no real repository. `sim/repo-notes.md` stands in for the code. A Build
  step implements a change by stating it exactly in its Handoff (what changes, where, and how to
  exercise it); the change then counts as made, and the runtime's simulator updates `sim/` from it.

## Art direction

Pastel palette, rounded shapes. Interactive pieces have a darker outline and a gentle idle motion.

## Design index

- `design/onboarding.md` — level 1–3 teaching plan.

# G-001: Children stall at the first puzzle

## Owner request

> 最初のパズルで子どもが手を止めてしまう。直したい

## Interpretation

Success condition: when children in the target group (ages 7–10) play the first puzzle (level 1 in
build 0.2), they begin purposeful touch interaction with the puzzle on their own, without a long
pause and without an adult having to explain what to do. How long a pause counts as "a stall" is
not set here; Observe reports what actually happens and Design turns it into a player-observable
acceptance criterion.

Out of scope:

- Levels 2 and later. If the same problem shows up there, it becomes a proposed new Goal.
- Changing a vision pillar or Decision D-001 (no failure, no timers). Any fix must stay inside them.
- New art beyond the existing sprite sheet (project constraint).

## Unknowns

Entry questions (`studio/workflows/development-loop.md`) the Project Context cannot answer:

- **Observe** — Has the stall been observed first-hand? No: the Project Context holds only the
  Owner's report. It is an experience problem, not a reproducible defect, so the Role is
  `playtester` (not `qa`). Creates stage 1.
- **Diagnose** — Is the cause understood? No. Creates stage 2 (`game-designer`). `art-director` was
  added in parallel (2b) because the observation pointed to something visual.
- **Design** — Is the intended behavior of the fixed first puzzle specified? No:
  `design/onboarding.md` specified the current level 1 and its teaching intent, not a fix. Creates
  stage 3. Build later found a gap (intro-cancel case), which reopened Design as 3d. Verify then
  found a gap (sand taps inside the pulse rate-limit window), which reopened Design as 3e; 3e is
  done (blip, hit area and notes settled in spec revision 2 and D-003). Build 4c then found one
  more gap (a sand tap during the 0.15 s ease-back, plus the 1.5 s window origin and a held-pool
  second finger), which reopened Design as 3f; 3f is done (spec revision 3 and D-004).
- **Build** — Must the game change? The Owner wants it fixed, so yes. Creates stage 4. Spec
  revision 2 changes player-facing behavior, so Build runs again as 4c; 4c held on the gap above,
  so Build resumed as 4d with spec revision 3; 4d is done (build 0.4).
- **Verify** — Always after Build. Stage 5, and 5b after 4d.
- **Play** — Is the Goal about how the game plays or feels? Yes. Stage 6, in a fresh context
  without the implementation history.
- **Review** — Is it an experience Goal? Yes. Stage 7 (`game-director`).
- **Next** — Always. Stage 8.

Skipped:

- **Decide** — Is there a real choice of direction, priority or scope? Not so far. The fix choices
  (A + B) are player-facing behavior inside the approved direction, which is `game-designer`
  authority. Option C (idle hint) is excluded from the spec; if it is wanted later, route Decide
  because it touches D-001.
- **Plan** — Is the technical approach non-obvious, risky, cross-system or parallelizable? No. The
  designer's spec describes a local level 1 change (parameters, a recolor, existing-sprite
  animation, per-object touch response); no cross-system structure is touched. Skipped. If Build
  finds the change is not local, the return rules send it to Plan.

Flag for Review (not a conclusion): the start-of-level intro motion is judged by the designer to be
outside D-001 (one-time, no timer, no inactivity trigger). `game-director` should confirm at Review.

Open item (not a Role question): whether iOS "Reduce Motion" / Android "Remove animations" are
available on the target platforms is unconfirmed. QA could not confirm it at Verify (target OS
versions are not named in the Project Context). The spec's static-brightness fallback works either
way. It does not block the Goal; carry it to Review / Close as an item for the Owner.

Resolved item: the source of the lifted pool's shadow was settled in 3e (no specific source
required; not player-facing; check 10 clarified).

Status: planned | tentative | open | done | skipped. The route is a plan; the Route operation
revises it.

## Route changes

After step 4d (22): Build is done as build 0.4 (spec revision 3, items 1–5); the engineer found no spec gap, so Plan stays skipped and nothing escalates. Verify 5b is open for `qa` with a fresh Handoff (23) that omits the Sender assessment and lists checks 1–18 (4, 13, 17, 18 new or changed). The report goes to `studio`; Play and Review stay planned.

## Next action

Run step 5b (Step operation): `qa` on `23-studio-to-qa.md`, reporting to `studio`. Then Route: if all 18 checks pass, compose a Playtester Handoff from permitted information only (build and player profile, no change or expected result) and open Play (6). If a criterion fails, apply the return rules (a second failure on the same criterion goes to `technical-director`). Carry the reduced-motion platform check and the home capture forward as non-blocking items. Phase 1: the Studio stops after every Route.

Status: active. Open: 15-studio-to-game-designer.md.

After step 5 (14): all 12 checks pass, but QA found a spec gap (G1: sand taps 0.6–1.5 s after a pulse get no response, against "no silent touches") plus notes N1–N4. Expected behavior is undefined, so Design reopens as 3e (game-designer) before Play, since a spec change would alter the build the Playtester sees. Build/Verify re-run only if the spec changes; Play stays planned.

Status: active. Open: 17-studio-to-gameplay-engineer.md.

After step 3e (16): the designer settled G1 and N1–N4 in spec revision 2 and D-003. Player-facing behavior changed (sand-tap blip, larger pool hit area, crab flip target, pulse precedence), so Build 4c is open and Verify 5b is confirmed (checks 1–16). Play stays after 5b. Plan stays skipped; no escalation.

## 021-route · 2026-10-12

After step 4c (18): Build held with `question` — a sand tap during the 0.15 s ease-back (pending pulse) is undefined; also the 1.5 s window origin and a held-pool second finger. Spec ambiguous, so Design reopens as 3f (game-designer); Build resumes as 4d, then Verify 5b (checks 1–16). Items 2–5 stay settled. Plan stays skipped; no escalation.

## 023-route · 2026-10-12

After step 3f (20): the designer settled the ease-back sand tap, 1.5 s window origin and held-pool second finger in spec revision 3 and D-004; no spec gap remains. Build resumes as 4d (item 1 changed, items 2–5 as planned), then Verify 5b with checks 1–18. Plan stays skipped; no escalation.

After step 4d (22): Build is done as build 0.4 (spec revision 3, items 1–5); the engineer found no spec gap, so Plan stays skipped and nothing escalates. Verify 5b is open for `qa` with a fresh Handoff (23) that omits the Sender assessment and lists checks 1–18 (4, 13, 17, 18 new or changed). The report goes to `studio`; Play and Review stay planned.

# 24: qa → studio — build 0.4 level 1 verification: 17 of 18 checks pass, check 4 fails under the reduce-motion setting

## Task

Route the failure of check 4 (reduce-motion condition) and the related spec gap. Compose the next handoffs. The Playtester must not receive this report's implementation details.

## Context

Goal G-001, verification of build 0.4 (level 1) against checks 1–18 of `design/onboarding.md` revision 3. This is a dry-run project. I verified by reading `sim/build-0.4.md` against the spec and decisions D-001 to D-004. I made no device capture or 60 fps recording. Every value below is what the build record states, not my own measurement. No implementer assessment was received. Checks 11, 17 and 18 have tight timing cases (0.05 s, 0.10 s, 0.15 s). These are judged from the stated build timings and need a real 60 fps recording to confirm.

## Findings

### Verdict per check

| # | Result | Evidence |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | PASS | About 1.6 s after load, only the pool has the darker outline and the continuous idle pulse (1.00–1.06, 2 s period). The crab and home have the lighter scenery outline and are still. |
| 2 | PASS (thin margin, stated value) | The build states about 1.8:1 in grayscale on the starting colors, against a threshold of 1.5:1. This is a stated value, not my pixel measurement. Re-measure on a real capture. |
| 3 | PASS (home capture still needed) | The crab has no bob and the lighter outline. The home has the lighter outline and no motion. Nothing else has a darker outline. The home capture is from the build text, not an image (non-blocking). |
| 4 | **FAIL under reduce-motion**; PASS in the default mode | See Failure F1. Default mode: crab, home, sand and pool taps all answer within 0.2 s, at 2 s spacing and as fast as possible. This also holds for a second tap during the ease-back (the pending pulse answers a sand tap, and the crab and home answer themselves) and for a second finger on a held pool (sand blip, or the object's own response). |
| 5 | PASS | The crab does not move. It leans about 10° and springs back. One pool pulse at touch-down, subject to the 1.5 s limit. |
| 6 | PASS | Pulses start at least 1.5 s apart, counted from the previous pulse start. Flashes do not count and do not delay a pulse. Five seconds of rapid tapping gives three or four pulses. |
| 7 | PASS | The intro plays once per load and not on rotation. A pool touch-down cancels it. The pool follows the finger from its drawn position, and the hit area follows the drawn position. |
| 8 | PASS | The level is completed by touch with the bubble hidden. |
| 9 | PASS | No failure, timer or inactivity cue. Nothing happens if the screen is left alone. Undo restores the previous position, and a second undo does nothing. |
| 10 | PASS | Only the existing sheet plus the procedural oval shadow. |
| 11 | PASS | In each of the three non-pool cases, the intro stops. The pool glides back in 0.15 s. The crab flip and wiggle, or the home glow, start within 0.1 s. For sand the response is the pulse. The pulse starts 0.15 s after touch-down. The idle pulse is hidden during it and then starts from 1.00. The pulse is not blocked, because it is the first non-pool touch of the load. |
| 12 | PASS | After any intro-cancel, drag, drop and undo return the pool to the authored start. A second undo does nothing, so there is no extra undo step. |
| 13 | PASS | After a pulse at t=0, a sand tap from 0.6 s to just under 1.5 s gives the 15% brightness rise (within 0.1 s, fade 0.3 s), with no scale change and no new pulse. It covers the whole 0.8–1.3 s range. A second tap while the flash shows does not restart it. A tap at 1.5 s or later starts a pulse and no flash. A tap in the first 0.6 s shows the pulse itself and no flash. |
| 14 | PASS | The outermost visible rim grabs the pool at idle 1.06 and redirect 1.15. A touch just outside the smallest size goes to the sand. The hit area is never below at-rest. |
| 15 | PASS | The flip uses the pool's logical position (authored start) during the slide and the ease-back. |
| 16 | PASS | After an intro-cancel by a non-pool touch, the pulse is shown from the end of the ease-back. The idle pulse is hidden during it and restarts from 1.00. After a flash-only tap, the idle pulse is unaffected. |
| 17 | PASS (confirm on 60 fps recording) | A second crab, home or sand tap during the glide plays only that object's own response. There is no flash and no extra pulse. Exactly one pulse starts, 0.15 s after the first touch, including for a tap at the 0.15 s boundary. The pool shows no brightness rise before it. A sand tap 0.6 s to under 1.5 s after that pulse start gives the flash. |
| 18 | PASS | A second-finger sand tap on a held pool gives the 15% flash (within 0.1 s, 0.3 s fade) whatever the time since the last pulse, unless one is already showing. The pool keeps its lift and shadow, with no pulse and no scale change. A crab or home tap gives only its own response. These taps do not move the 1.5 s window. After release, a sand tap behaves as in check 13, counted from the last pulse that actually started. |

### Failure F1: check 4, reduce-motion, silent sand tap 0.4–0.6 s after a pulse start

- **Criterion:** check 4, "Touch-down on … the sand … each produces a visible response within 0.2 s … This holds for every tap, whatever the time since the previous tap … leaves no silent touches."
- **Observed (build record, "Devices with a reduce-motion setting turned on"):** with the setting on, a pulse is replaced by a brightness change of about 0.4 s. A sand tap 0.4–0.6 s after a pulse started shows nothing. The brightness change has ended, no new pulse is allowed, and no flash plays. The build itself calls this "a gap in the response". It also states the one exception to "every touch shows a response" in the default list.
- **Cause (spec):** rule 5 says a sand tap gets no flash during the first 0.6 s after a pulse start, because "the pulse is already the visible response". That window is sized for the 0.6 s scale pulse. The reduce-motion edge case shortens the visible pulse to about 0.4 s. For 0.2 s of the window, nothing is visible.
- **Conditions:** devices where the OS reduce-motion setting exists and is on (iOS "Reduce Motion", Android "Remove animations"), on level 1, any sand tap in that 0.2 s span after a pulse start. In the default mode this window is covered by the 0.6 s pulse.
- **Reproducibility:** always, for the stated timing, from the build text. Not run on a device.
- **Severity:** low to medium. The window is 0.2 s wide and only on reduce-motion devices. It breaks the "no silent touches" intent for the affected children. It does not block the level, and D-001 is not affected.
- **Why QA does not pass it:** the criterion is explicit, and the build knowingly leaves the gap. I do not decide how to close it.
- **Fix is a design choice (for `game-designer`):** the criterion states the outcome (a visible response), but the mechanism is open. For example: end the "pulse is the response" window at 0.4 s when reduce-motion is on, so the flash covers 0.4 s onward. Or make the reduce-motion pulse last 0.6 s. Either changes rule 5 condition (2) or the reduce-motion edge case. Then `gameplay-engineer` implements it.
- **Acceptance for the fix:** with reduce-motion on, a sand tap at any time from 0 s to 1.5 s after a pulse start shows a visible response within 0.2 s (the pulse brightness change or the flash), and check 13 still holds. In default mode nothing changes.

### Spec gaps and notes (no other check fails)

- **S1 (same root as F1):** the spec says the flash "cannot look like a pulse" because it has no scale change. With reduce-motion on, both the pulse and the flash are plain brightness changes, so the two cannot be told apart by scale. The spec does not say whether that is acceptable. Not a failure. Ask the game-designer to confirm.
- **S2: reduce-motion cannot exercise the intro checks.** The intro is skipped with the setting on, so checks 7, 11, 15 and 17 do not arise there, as the spec says. Check 16 and the other checks are the ones to run in that mode.
- **S3: tight timing.** Checks 11, 17 and 18 need a 60 fps recording to confirm the 0.05 s, 0.10 s and 0.15 s cases on a real device. I confirmed them only from the build's stated behavior.

### Regressions checked

- Levels 2 and 3: the build record says they are unchanged. No level 1 rule touches them. I did not run them. No regression found.
- Level 1: pool drag 1:1, clamping, release shrink over 0.15 s, drop on home completes, drop on crab leaves the pool with no crab reaction, home glow within 1.5 pool-widths while dragged only, crab facing the pool while dragged, rotation not replaying the intro, a second finger on a held pool ignored. All as in the spec.
- A pool touch during the ease-back cancels the ease-back and the pending pulse, and starts no window. Undo is unchanged in every intro case.
- Pulse cut short by grabbing the pool: the 1.5 s still counts from its start. The spec and the build agree.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: holds in 0.4. No failure, timer or inactivity cue.
- D-002: holds. The ease-back is 0.15 s and the intro is never in the undo history.
- D-003 and D-004: the build matches them in the default mode (blip, hit area, ease-back taps, window origin, held pool). The reduce-motion gap in F1 sits at the edge of D-003's "pulse is already the response" assumption.

## Constraints

- Level 1 only. Touch only. No mechanic may depend on reading text.
- Existing sprite sheet only, plus the procedural shadow.
- Studio rule: this is the first failure of this form for check 4. In handoff 14 check 4 passed with the then-defined window gap reported as G1. If check 4 fails again after the fix, the Studio routes to `technical-director`.
- The Playtester receives only permitted information. Do not pass this report's reading of the build, F1 or S1 to the Playtester.

## Open questions

- **Reduce-motion availability (non-blocking):** iOS has "Reduce Motion" and apps can read it. Android has "Remove animations" (Android 9 and later), readable through the system animation scale settings. This is general platform knowledge, not from the packet. The target OS versions and devices are not named, so I cannot confirm availability on the actual targets. It matters now, because F1 is reachable only where the setting exists. If a target platform has no such setting, F1 is unreachable there. The Studio should name the target platforms and versions.
- **Home styling capture (non-blocking):** the build text describes the lighter scenery outline and no motion. No real image was available. Take one at level start for the record.
- **For game-designer:** choose how reduce-motion closes the 0.4–0.6 s silent window (F1) and say whether S1 is acceptable.

## Expected output

Route F1 to `game-designer` for the mechanism choice, then to `gameplay-engineer` for the fix, then back to QA to re-verify check 4 under reduce-motion and checks 13 and 16 for regressions. The default-mode behavior of build 0.4 is clean. The Playtester round can proceed on devices with the reduce-motion setting off. Tell the Playtester only what children should be observed doing:
- Does the child touch the pool within about 10 s?
- Does the child tap the sand, crab or home and then go to the pool?
- Does the child ever tap repeatedly and seem to feel ignored?
