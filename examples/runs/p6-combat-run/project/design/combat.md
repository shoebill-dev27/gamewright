# Combat design (build 0.5 target — Option A, G-001)

Status: spec for Option A (D-002), written from the rooms 1–3 and rooms 4–5 playtests and QA's report (06). Supersedes the build 0.4 text. Updated after QA's second round (handoff 29): overlap rule and AC-15 wording (D-006). Updated after playtests 50 and 54 (handoff 59): grub spacing and engagement cap, shorter hit-stun, body-hit rule, dash and facing rules, swipe cases, miss wording (D-011). Acceptance criteria AC-19 to AC-27 are new. Updated after the engineer's hand-back (63, answered in 65): knockback of a grub on the player's tile (D-013, AC-28), and rewrites of the dash-and-walls, Waiting and AC-23 passages (no rule change in those three). Updated after QA's verification (70, answered in 73): one rule for cells, sides and "on you" (D-014); knockback of an on-you grub reworded; AC-17, AC-28 reworded; AC-29 and AC-30 are new.

## Experience intent

Every enemy does something the player can read, answer and profit from. A grub is a threat with a beat: it approaches, winds up, strikes, then is open to a counter. A spitter is a threat on a rhythm that the player can dodge or break by walking up and hitting it. The player's attack visibly changes the enemy. Fights are decided by spacing and timing with attack and dash only (D-001, pillars 1 and 3). A group of grubs takes turns: the player always has a gap to answer in and is never boxed in by simultaneous bites.

## Conventions

- All timings are in seconds and must hold at 30 and 60 FPS (section "30 / 60 FPS").
- Distances are in tiles. The room is 16×9 (x 0–15, y 0–8).
- "Telegraph" means a change the player can see in the player view, at least one on-map change plus one text line. Threat colors are saturated orange/red. The on-map change must be visible in a cell the player can see: an enemy glyph is never hidden under `P` (see "Overlap with the player").
- Values marked **[tune]** are starting values the designer expects to adjust after a live playtest of the Option A build.
- "True position" is the simulated position of an enemy, not the cell where its glyph is drawn.
- Cells, sides, "on you" and position words follow one rule, "Cells, sides and 'on you'" below. Nothing else may define them.

## Cells, sides and "on you" (D-014)

One definition, used by the draw, every text line that names a position, the `on you:` line, the hit line and the knockback. It depends only on true positions and never on the frame rate.

1. **Cell of a position.** Per axis, `cell(v) = floor(v + 0.5 + 0.005)`. That is rounding to the nearest tile, where an exact .5 (and any value within 0.005 below it) goes to the larger index (right, down). Examples: 13.5 → 14; 14.5 → 15; 14.49 → 15; 14.49 − 0.01 → 14. Banker's rounding and bare float comparison at .5 are not allowed. The player is drawn in `cell(player)`.
2. **On you.** An enemy is *on you* when its true distance to the player is 0.5 tile or less (the body-hit radius of A3, same test, with a tolerance of 1e-6). Nothing else makes an enemy "on you". So a swipe always hits an enemy that is on you, and an enemy that can be missed is never called on you.
3. **Position word of an enemy not on you.** Let (cx, cy) be `cell(enemy) − cell(player)`. If both are 0 (same cell, but farther than 0.5 tile), use the unit step along the larger axis of the true offset (ties: horizontal) instead. Then: (±1 or more, 0) → `left` / `right`; (0, ±) → `above` / `below`; both non-zero → `top left`, `top right`, `bottom left`, `bottom right`. The word therefore always names the side of `P` on which the glyph is drawn.
4. **Position word of an enemy on you:** `on you`, in every line.
5. **Drawn cell.** A not-on-you enemy is drawn in `cell(enemy)`, except when that equals the player's cell: it is then drawn in the neighbour cell given by the step of rule 3. An on-you enemy is drawn in its own cell when that is a straight neighbour of the player's cell; otherwise (same cell or diagonal) it is drawn in a displaced straight neighbour: the side last approached or struck from, else right, left, above, below, in that order, taking only cells that are inside the room and free (if all four are taken, the next free cell by distance). The displaced cell is a display offset only. The `on you:` line states the side drawn.
6. **Frame rate.** The rules use true positions at the moment of the draw or line. Resting positions (a knocked-back grub at x=13.5, a waiting grub at 2.0 tiles) must give the same cell at 30 and 60 FPS.

Everything that says "same tile", "(on you)", "left", "right" and so on below means these rules.

## Player kit

- **Attack** (one button): a swipe in the facing direction.
  - Damage 1. Recovery 0.35 s.
  - Reach 1.5 tiles, in a 90° cone centred on the facing direction.
  - **Body-hit rule (A3):** an enemy whose true position is within 0.5 tile of the player (including distance 0, "on you") is hit by every swipe, whatever the facing. The swipe still draws its arc in the facing direction.
  - A swipe hits every enemy that is in the cone or inside the body-hit radius. Hitting two enemies with one swipe is intended and rewards positioning.
  - **Swipe in any enemy state:** a swipe resolves against true positions at the moment of the press, whatever state the enemy is in (Approach, waiting, Wind-up, Strike, Recovery). See the grub rules for what the hit does.
  - **Swipe result line and an on-you grub (Q2):** the result line is the same wherever the grub is: "you swipe: grub hit (1 left)". It never carries "(on you)". The position of an on-you grub is read from the `on you:` line.
  - Rulings in "Attack feedback" below.
- **Facing:** movement sets facing to the movement direction. The player cannot turn without moving or dashing (D-001; see D-011 on why this is held).
- **Dash**: up to 4 tiles over 0.25 s, invulnerable for the full dash. Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends. The dash passes through enemies and projectiles without harm.
  - **Dash direction:** `dash <dir>` goes in that direction. A dash without a direction goes the way the player faces.
  - **Dash and facing (A5):** a dash sets facing to the dash direction, like movement does. A queued attack fires in that direction. A dash without direction leaves facing unchanged.
  - **Dash and walls (A5):** a dash that would leave the room stops at the room edge and is never cancelled; it covers the shorter of 4 tiles and the distance to the edge, and every dash lasts exactly 0.25 s with invulnerability for all of it, even when a wall shortens it.
  - Dash starts from the player's true position; any partial tile is kept (no snapping to the grid).
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, then **0.15 s hit-stun (no input) [tune]** (was 0.3 s), then invulnerability until 0.8 s after the hit (unchanged).
- **Hearts**: 3 maximum.
- **Moving while attacking**: allowed. Movement continues during the 0.35 s recovery.

## Enemies

### Grub (HP 2)

States: **Approach → (Waiting) → Wind-up → Strike → Recovery → Approach**.

| State | Duration | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | until in range | Walks at the player at 2.0 tiles/s (as observed). Harmless. |
| Waiting | until allowed | The grub is blocked by the spacing rule or the engagement cap below. It is harmless, with normal glyph `g`/`w`, and prints no text line. What it does while waiting is set out under "Waiting positions". |
| Wind-up | 0.5 s **[tune]** | Starts when the grub is within 1.25 tiles of the player and the rules below allow it. The grub stops, and its glyph and color change (see "Feedback"). A text line "a grub rears back" prints. It deals no damage. |
| Strike | 0.15 s | A short lunge of up to 1 tile toward where the player stood when the wind-up ended. It damages the player once (1 heart) if the player is within 1.0 tile of the grub at any moment of the strike and is not invulnerable. |
| Recovery | 0.9 s **[tune]** | The grub stands still, "open". No damage. Its normal glyph returns. |

- Cycle with a player standing still: 0.5 + 0.15 + 0.9 = about 1.55 s per bite.
- **Strike-start position (D-014):** when a Strike begins (the instant the Wind-up ends), the position word of the grub, by the rule in "Cells, sides and 'on you'", is fixed for that strike. The hit line of that strike uses this word (see visuals spec, "Hit lines name the attacker"). The grub does not move during Wind-up, so for a still player this is the same word as in the "rears back" line.
- **Wind-up spacing (A1):** a grub may not start a Wind-up within **1.0 s [tune]** of the start of any other grub's Wind-up (a cancelled or defeated grub's wind-up start still counts). A grub that is blocked becomes Waiting. When the window ends, the nearest Waiting grub starts first; ties go to the grub that has waited longest. With one grub in the room the rule has no effect. A grub's own cycle is unchanged.
- **Engagement cap (second rule, D-011):** at most **2** grubs may be within 1.5 tiles of the player at once, counted in every state, by true position. A grub that has reached 2.0 tiles from the player while two grubs are inside 1.5 tiles becomes Waiting at that distance and enters when a slot frees (a grub is defeated, or is knocked back or pushed out beyond 1.5 tiles). The nearest waiting grub enters first. The cap limits where grubs move; it does not stop the player from walking or dashing next to more grubs, because there is no collision.
- **Waiting positions (clarified, no rule change):**
  - *Blocked by the cap:* the grub holds at 2.0 tiles or more. If the player walks toward it, it backs off to stay at 2.0 tiles or more; if the player walks away, it follows to stay at about 2.0 tiles. When a slot frees it resumes Approach.
  - *Blocked by the spacing window only:* the grub keeps approaching until it is within 1.25 tiles, then stands still in place until the window ends. A grub that is already inside 1.5 tiles when it gets blocked stands still where it is. It does not retreat, and it counts as one of the two in the cap.
  - A grub between 1.25 and 2.0 tiles is therefore either still approaching (a slot is free), or on its way back to 2.0 tiles (cap full and it is outside 1.5 tiles). It is never standing still there.
- **Attack limit (kept):** at most 2 grubs may be in Wind-up or Strike at the same time. With the 1.0 s spacing this is nearly always at most 1, but the limit is kept as a backstop.
- **Player hits on a grub:**
  - First hit (HP 2→1): the grub is knocked back 1 tile over 0.2 s and shows the damaged state. Direction and room edge are set under "Knockback direction" below.
  - A hit during Wind-up cancels the wind-up. The grub goes straight into a 0.6 s Recovery and does not strike.
  - **A hit during Strike (A5)** cancels the rest of the strike: if the strike has not yet damaged the player in that tick or earlier, no heart is lost. The grub goes into a 0.6 s Recovery. Player attacks resolve before enemy damage in each tick (same order as room clear).
  - A hit during Recovery or Approach/Waiting: damage and knockback as above; Recovery continues for its remaining time.
  - Second hit: the grub is defeated.
- Grubs never damage the player outside Strike, so the dash and spacing are the answers: step back, or dash through the wind-up, then counter in Recovery. Hitting a winding-up grub (interrupt) is the best answer.

#### Knockback direction (Q1, D-013, reworded by D-014)

- **Normal case (not on you):** a grub farther than 0.5 tile from the player (true) is knocked back 1 tile straight away from the player, along the line from the player to the grub. A knockback toward an edge is clamped at the edge, the same way a dash is.
- **Grub on you (within 0.5 tile, rule 2 of "Cells, sides and 'on you'"):** it is knocked toward the side on which it is drawn (rule 5) and ends **1.0 tile from the player's true position on that side**, which is the cell where its glyph was already drawn. The player sees the grub step out to the side it was shown on, and nothing jumps to the other side. For a grub exactly on the player this is the same as moving 1 tile toward that side.
- **Display side and room edge:** the drawn side is chosen only among cells inside the room (rule 5), so a grub on a player at an edge is never shown outside the room. For the knockback, the end point (player + 1.0 in the side's direction) must be inside the room. If it is not, the next side in the order right, left, above, below with a valid end point is used, and the glyph must have been drawn on that side already: because the display side obeys the same in-room test, the two always agree. Example: `player 14.5 4` with a grub on the player's tile is drawn left of `P` from the first draw and ends at x 13.5; it is never drawn on the right.
- **Slots:** a grub knocked back from within 0.5 tile ends 1.0 tile from the player, so it stays inside 1.5 tiles and keeps counting toward the cap of 2. A first hit on an on-you grub does not free a slot. A grub hit from more than 0.5 tile away ends more than 1.5 tiles away only when it was at least 0.5 tile out (distance + 1.0 ≥ 1.5), which is always the case in the normal case, so it frees a slot.
- **Cycle:** knockback changes where the grub is, not its state or timers. The AC-4 timing (next bite no sooner than 1.5 s after the previous one for a still player) is unchanged. A knocked-back grub walks back in Approach if it is not in Recovery, or stays where it landed until Recovery ends.
- **Timing of the display:** the knockback takes 0.2 s. The immediate draw at the swipe may still show the grub on the tile with its `on you:` entry. A draw made 0.2 s or later after the hit shows it on the knockback side as a normal neighbor, with no `on you:` entry for it (V-17, AC-28). Resting at the end point (for example x 13.5) must show the same cell at 30 and 60 FPS (rule 1 and 6).

### Spitter (HP 2)

States: **Idle → Charge → Fire → Recovery → Idle**.

| State | Duration | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | until its next volley time | Stationary. Harmless. |
| Charge | 0.8 s **[tune]** | A visible charge-up: glyph and color change, and a text line "spitter (top right) charges". The aim point is locked when the charge ends. |
| Fire | instant | Fires one projectile toward the locked aim point: the player's position at the end of the charge. |
| Recovery | 0.6 s | Stationary, harmless, normal glyph. |

- **Volley interval:** one volley (Charge start to next Charge start) every 2.5 s **[tune]**.
- **Staggering:** spitters never fire together. In a room, spitter k (k = 0, 1, 2 in spawn-list order) starts its first Charge at 1.0 + 0.8·k s after the room starts, then repeats every 2.5 s.
- **Projectile:** speed 3.0 tiles/s **[tune]**; flies in a straight line to the locked aim point and continues until it leaves the room or hits the player. It damages the player for 1 heart on contact (unless invulnerable or dashing). It is saturated orange/red and visible for the whole flight.
- **Dodge:** because the aim point is fixed at the end of the charge, moving off the locked line, or dashing through it, avoids the projectile. A dash through a projectile is safe.
- **Approachable (ruling):** yes. Spitters stay stationary (moving spitters belong to deferred Option B), but a player can walk up and swipe at one at any time. A hit during Charge cancels the charge and staggers the spitter for 1.0 s, after which its next Charge starts. A hit in any state shows the damaged state. The second hit defeats it.
- Spitters have no melee attack. A player standing next to one is hit only by its projectiles.
- The grub spacing and engagement rules do not apply to spitters.

### Group behavior

- A grub is never threatened by friendly projectiles. Projectiles only affect the player.
- Enemies do not block projectiles.
- Grubs take turns (spacing) and crowd at most two deep (cap). Grubs in the same room still all arrive at about the same time; staggered arrival stays Option B (D-002).

### Overlap with the player (F1 ruling, D-006; cells per D-014)

- **Physics unchanged.** Enemies and the player have no collision. A grub's lunge and recovery may leave it within the player's tile, and the player may walk or dash onto an enemy. This adds no rule to movement, timing, damage or hit tests; all of those use true positions.
- **Display rule.** In the player view no enemy is ever hidden under `P`. The player is always drawn on their own cell. Which cell an enemy is drawn in, including the displaced cell, is set by rule 5 of "Cells, sides and 'on you'". It applies when an enemy is on you, and also when an enemy is farther than 0.5 tile but still rounds to the player's cell.
- It applies in every state, so a grub in Recovery that is "open (on you)" is also visible and its counter can be read. It applies to both enemy types and to damaged glyphs.
- Two enemies sharing the player's cell are displaced to different cells.
- The text lines print the position words of the same rules ("(on you)" only for an enemy within 0.5 tile). The displaced glyph is the on-map change that makes the telegraph complete.
- The immediate draws at Wind-up start, Strike and Recovery start (visuals spec principle 4) use this rule too.
- A displaced glyph does not mean the enemy has moved. A swipe hits by true position, so a swipe may hit an enemy drawn on a different side than the arc. The body-hit rule makes this safe for an enemy "on you": it is always hit. An enemy that is displaced but farther than 0.5 tile is not "on you" and can be missed; its word is the side it is drawn on.
- The display side of an on-you grub is also the direction in which it is knocked back by the first hit (see "Knockback direction").

## Attack feedback (applies to all enemies)

- **Swipe is always visible.** Every swipe, hit or miss, draws a short arc on the map for 0.15 s in the facing direction.
- **Damaged state.** After 1 hit an enemy shows a distinct glyph/color, and the hit line states its remaining HP: "you swipe: grub hit (1 left)". A defeat prints "grub defeated".
- **Multi-hit.** A swipe that hits two enemies prints one hit line per enemy.
- **"(nothing happens)" ruling (Q6).** It is intended that a swipe sometimes does nothing, but never silently. It must say why:
  - "(miss)": the swipe landed but no enemy was hit. The line keeps the word "(miss)" and adds a cause when one is known (A5):
    - "(miss) too far": no enemy was hit, and at least one living enemy is within 2.5 tiles of the player but beyond the 1.5-tile reach.
    - "(miss) not in front": no enemy was hit, and at least one living enemy is within 1.5 tiles but outside the cone and outside the 0.5-tile body-hit radius.
    - "(miss)" alone otherwise. If both causes apply, "not in front" is printed.
  - "(too soon)": the 0.35 s recovery after the previous swipe has not finished.
  - "(stunned)": hit-stun, the first 0.15 s after taking a hit.
  - "(down)": the player is at zero hearts.
- The glyph and color for each state (full, wind-up/charge, damaged) is chosen in Build and documented in the manual. Wind-up and charge are saturated orange/red. The three states must be distinguishable in the player view.

## Player down, game over and room clear

### Zero hearts (Q2)

- At 0 hearts the player is **down**. The marker `x` replaces `P`.
- Immediately: all enemies stop acting (no new Wind-up, Charge or Fire), and enemy projectiles in flight are removed. A line prints: "you went down".
- Input while down does nothing, but it is never silent. An attack prints "(down)". Move and dash do nothing.
- After 2.0 s down, the screen shows "run over — rooms cleared: N" and the run ends.
- A new run starts at room 1 with 3 hearts when the attack button is pressed after the run-over screen is shown. (Pause remains available.) A scripted session ends at the run-over screen.
- This rule changes no input and does not change run length (15–20 min). See D-003.

### Room cleared (Q3)

- A room is cleared when its last enemy is defeated. The check runs after the player's attacks and before enemy damage in each tick, so a swipe that defeats the last enemy cancels any strike or projectile hit due on that tick.
- On clear, all projectiles are removed, "room cleared" prints, and the player is healed 1 heart (not above 3) **[tune]**.
- Hearts otherwise carry over between rooms.
- Input stays active for 1.5 s (the player can walk and swipe; nothing can hurt them), then the next room loads with the player at the start position x 8, y 4. Clearing room 5 prints "run complete" and ends the run like the run-over screen.
- **Cleared while down:** impossible. Once the player is down, enemies stop acting and the room cannot clear (see tick order above); down takes priority.
- Rooms do not restart in place. A clear is never undone.

### Practice room (Q4)

- `room empty` starts with no enemies and is not part of a run. `spawn` and `player` lines place things.
- "Room cleared" prints when the last spawned enemy is defeated. There is no heal and no room transition; the session continues to its `end` time.
- If the player goes down, the same down rules apply except that the session ends after the 2.0 s instead of showing a run-over screen.
- **Binding wording (ruling, D-006):** the `x` marker and the practice room must both be listed in the `manual.md` section On screen (`manual.md#on-screen`). The mention in the Script table and in "Rooms and runs" does not satisfy this alone. AC-15 is worded to match.

## Rooms (Q1)

- 5 rooms, 3–6 enemies each. **Mixed Grubs and Spitters applies across the set of rooms, not per room.**
- Layouts (unchanged from build 0.4): room 1 = 3 grubs; room 2 = 4 grubs; room 3 = 3 spitters; room 4 = 2 grubs + 2 spitters; room 5 = 3 grubs + 2 spitters.
- Room 1 composition is not changed (D-011 rejects D2 for now).
- Per-room mixing, moving spitters and staggered grub arrival are Option B and stay deferred (D-002).
- A room ends when all enemies are defeated.

## Edge cases

- **Simultaneous hits on the player (grub strike and projectile in the same tick):** one heart is lost, and the 0.8 s invulnerability covers the other.
- **Player hit during an attack's recovery:** the recovery continues after the stun; the swipe shows "(stunned)" if pressed during stun.
- **Dash during stun:** ignored with "(stunned)". The stun is 0.15 s; a dash pressed after it is accepted if the cooldown allows ("(dash not ready)" otherwise).
- **Enemy defeated mid-state:** it stops acting at once. A defeated grub does not strike.
- **Two grubs wanting the same slot (spacing window, Wind-up limit or engagement cap):** the nearer grub takes the free slot; a tie goes to the grub that has waited longest.
- **Four grubs around a still player (room 2):** at most 2 are within 1.5 tiles, Wind-ups start at least 1.0 s apart, and the others wait at 2.0 tiles. The player has at least 1.0 s between committed bites to dash out or counter.
- **Grub knocked out of the engagement zone:** it frees a slot at once; it is Approach again and may be Waiting if the cap is full when it returns. A grub hit while on you is not knocked out of the zone (it ends 1.0 tile away), see "Knockback direction".
- **Player dashes through a grub in Wind-up:** the grub still completes its Wind-up, Strike (toward where the player stood when the wind-up ended) and Recovery; its strike misses if the player is more than 1.0 tile away.
- **Swipe at the same tick as a strike's damage:** the swipe resolves first (see "Player hits on a grub").
- **Dash into a wall or into the room edge:** stops at the edge, see Dash.
- **Spitter Charge canceled by a hit:** the projectile is not fired.
- **Enemy on you:** see "Cells, sides and 'on you'" and "Overlap with the player". It is drawn beside `P`; the body-hit rule means a swipe always hits it; the first hit knocks it onto the side it is drawn on.
- **Enemy at an exact half tile (x.5):** the cell rule decides; the result is the same at 30 and 60 FPS (rule 1 and 6).
- **Player at the room edge with an enemy on you:** the displaced cell is always inside the room.
- **Player down while an enemy shares the cell:** `x` is drawn on the player's cell and the enemy keeps its displaced cell.
- **Pause:** all timers freeze.

## 30 / 60 FPS (Q5)

- Every timer above runs on elapsed seconds, not frame counts. This includes the spacing window (1.0 s), the dash duration, the hit-stun (0.15 s) and the knockback (0.2 s).
- Tolerance: an event's trace timestamp may differ from its spec time by at most 0.04 s at 30 FPS and 0.02 s at 60 FPS.
- The Strike damage window (0.15 s) must cover at least 4 frames at 30 FPS.
- The hit-stun (0.15 s) is at least 4 frames at 30 FPS; it ends at the first tick at or after 0.15 s.
- Dash distance (4 tiles) may differ between 30 and 60 FPS by at most 0.25 tiles.
- Running the same script at `fps 30` and `fps 60` gives the same sequence of events, with timestamps within 0.07 s of each other.
- Displayed cells, position words, the `on you:` line and the hit-line word for a still player are identical at both rates (D-014). Positions that rest on a half tile are the case that most often breaks this.

## Acceptance criteria

### Verification (QA; trace view and player view; each at `fps 30` and `fps 60`)

- **AC-1 Grub telegraph:** in the practice room, a grub starting at distance 4 on an idle player produces "a grub rears back" and a changed glyph at least 0.45 s before the first heart is lost. No heart is lost during Approach or Recovery.
- **AC-2 Grub timing:** wind-up 0.5 s, strike 0.15 s, recovery 0.9 s, each within tolerance.
- **AC-3 Grub dodge:** a player who dashes away at any time in the wind-up loses no heart on that strike.
- **AC-4 Grub counter:** a swipe during Recovery hits and the grub shows a damaged state; the next bite then arrives no sooner than 1.5 s after the previous one for a still player.
- **AC-5 Interrupt:** a swipe that hits a winding-up grub cancels its strike (no heart lost) and puts it in a 0.6 s Recovery.
- **AC-6 Attack limit:** in room 5, no more than 2 grubs are in Wind-up/Strike at any time (from the trace).
- **AC-7 Spitter stagger:** in rooms 4 and 5, the two spitters never start a Charge or fire in the same 0.5 s. The first Charge starts at 1.0 s and 1.8 s, and each spitter repeats every 2.5 s.
- **AC-8 Spitter telegraph:** "spitter (position) charges" and a changed glyph appear 0.8 s before each shot. The spit line names its spitter; there are no identical duplicate lines at one timestamp.
- **AC-9 Projectile dodge:** a player who has moved at least 1 tile off the locked line (or dashes through it) before the projectile arrives takes no damage. A player who stays still on that line is hit for 1 heart.
- **AC-10 Spitter approach:** a player can walk to a spitter in room 3 and defeat it with 2 swipes, and a hit during Charge cancels that shot.
- **AC-11 Hit feedback:** each swipe prints exactly one outcome per enemy hit ("hit (1 left)", "defeated") or one reason ("miss", "too soon", "stunned", "down"). "(nothing happens)" never appears without a reason. A damaged enemy has a distinct glyph/color from a full-HP one. (The "(miss)" line may carry a cause, see AC-27.)
- **AC-12 Multi-hit:** one swipe with two grubs inside the cone prints two hit lines.
- **AC-13 Zero hearts:** after the third hit, "you went down" prints, `x` replaces `P`, enemies stop, projectiles vanish, and attack prints "(down)". After 2.0 s the run-over screen shows. Pressing attack there starts room 1 with 3 hearts.
- **AC-14 Room clear:** "room cleared" prints on the last defeat, projectiles vanish, hearts +1 (max 3), and the next room loads after 1.5 s. A clearing swipe at the same tick as a would-be strike results in no damage. Clearing room 5 prints "run complete".
- **AC-15 Practice room:** `room empty` works as described, and both `x` and the practice room are listed in `manual.md#on-screen` (the On screen section, not only the Script table or Rooms and runs).
- **AC-16 Room mix:** the trace setup rows match the layouts above.
- **AC-17 Frame rate:** AC-1…AC-14 and AC-18…AC-30 pass at both frame rates, and the 30/60 comparison above holds (including identical cells and position words, AC-29 and AC-30).
- **AC-18 No hidden enemy:** in the practice room with an idle player and one grub at distance 4, run to 5.5 s, every draw that shows a living grub has a grub glyph in a cell different from the player's cell. Every "a grub rears back" line, including those marked "(on you)", comes with an uppercase `G` or `W` visible on the map in the draw made at that moment. Same for "the grub is open (on you)": a lowercase `g` or `w` is visible. Also, with `player 8 4` and `spawn spitter 8.2 4`, the draws show `P` and an `s` in a neighbouring cell; the spitter's `S` is visible beside `P` during its Charge. The trace shows no change to timings, hearts or positions compared with a build without the display rule (the events of AC-1…AC-4 stay within tolerance).
- **AC-19 Wind-up spacing (A1):** in room 2 with a still player, run to 12 s (or until down): for every pair of grub Wind-up starts in the trace, the later one is at least 0.96 s after the earlier one at 60 FPS and 0.92 s at 30 FPS (1.0 s minus tolerance), whichever grubs they belong to. The same holds in room 1 and room 5. A room with a single grub shows the AC-2 cycle unchanged.
- **AC-20 Engagement cap:** in room 2 with a still player at x 8, y 4, the trace shows at no sample more than 2 grubs within 1.5 tiles of the player, from the start to the end of the run. The remaining grubs are present in the draws at about 2.0 tiles with lowercase glyphs and no "rears back" line until a slot frees.
- **AC-21 Turns, not a ring:** in room 2 with a still player, the time between the first and the third heart lost is at least 1.9 s. No two Wind-up starts fall within 1.0 s (AC-19), so the trace shows at most one grub in Wind-up or Strike at any sample.
- **AC-22 Hit-stun:** after a heart is lost, an attack pressed 0.05 s later prints "(stunned)" and does nothing. An attack pressed 0.25 s later swipes normally. A dash behaves the same way (subject to its cooldown). The stun lasts 0.15 s within tolerance. Invulnerability still ends 0.8 s after the hit.
- **AC-23 Body hit (A3):** three practice-room checks, each at both frame rates.
  - (a) On you: `player 8 4` and `spawn grub 8.2 4`, with no movement before the swipe (default facing). The swipe hits the grub and prints "grub hit (1 left)", whatever the facing.
  - (b) Just behind: `player 8 4`, `move right` then `stop` (facing right), and a grub spawned 0.4 tile to the left of the player's true position. The swipe hits it. Repeat with `move left` then `stop` and the grub 0.4 tile to the right.
  - (c) Further behind: with the same setups as (b), a grub 0.8 tile behind the player is not hit and the swipe prints "(miss) not in front".
- **AC-24 Dash and facing (A5):** in the practice room, `player 8 4`, face right (move right then stop), then `dash left`, then an attack after the dash: the arc is drawn as `(` (facing left). A `dash` without a direction while facing up leaves facing up. A queued attack pressed during a dash fires after it ends in the dash direction.
- **AC-25 Dash distance (A5):** in the practice room from `player 8 4`, `dash right` ends at 12.0 ± 0.25 on x at both frame rates and takes 0.25 s within tolerance. From `player 2 4`, `dash left` ends at the room edge (x 0, never outside the room), takes 0.25 s within tolerance even though it covers only 2 tiles, and the player takes no damage during it. Dash during the cooldown prints "(dash not ready)" and does nothing.
- **AC-26 Swipe during Strike and Recovery (A5):** with one grub in the practice room, a swipe pressed while the trace shows the grub in Strike hits it ("grub hit (1 left)") and no heart is lost to that strike if the swipe's tick comes at or before the damage tick. A swipe pressed while the grub is in Recovery and adjacent in front hits it. Neither case prints "(miss)". (Known: the cancel window is one tick wide, 0.033 s at 30 FPS; this is as written.)
- **AC-27 Miss wording (A5):** a swipe with a grub 2.0 tiles in front prints "(miss) too far". A swipe with a grub at 1.0 tile directly to the side (outside the cone) prints "(miss) not in front". A swipe with nothing within 2.5 tiles prints "(miss)" alone. All three also draw the arc.
- **AC-28 Knockback of an on-you grub (Q1, D-013, D-014):** in the practice room, one grub, a still player, and a swipe on the first hit. Read the true positions from the trace and the cells from the draws.
  - (a) `player 8 4`, `spawn grub 8 4`. The grub is shown on some side of `P` (the `on you:` line says which). After the first hit, a draw made 0.2 s or more later shows the damaged grub (`w`/`W`) at 1.0 ± 0.1 tile from the player, in the cell on that same side, with no `on you:` entry for it. The grub did not appear on any other side in any draw. The same with `spawn grub 8.2 4`: the grub ends 1.0 ± 0.1 tile from the player's true position, on the side shown.
  - (b) Edge: `player 14.5 4`, `spawn grub 14.5 4`. From the first draw to the hit the grub is shown **left** of `P` (never right; there is no cell to the right), and every text line names it "(on you)", never "(left)" or "(right)" at the same time as the on-you entry. After the first hit it ends at x 13.5 ± 0.1 (1.0 tile left of the player), inside the room, and a draw 0.2 s or later shows it left of `P` with no `on you:` entry, at both frame rates and with the same cell and the same words in both. It is never inside 0.9 tile of the player.
  - (c) With room 2 and two other grubs inside 1.5 tiles, a first hit on an on-you grub leaves it inside 1.5 tiles, so the trace shows no third grub entering the zone because of that hit. A first hit on a grub 0.6 tile or more away leaves it at 1.5 tiles or more.
  - (d) The grub's state timers are unchanged by the knockback (AC-4: next bite no sooner than 1.5 s after the previous one for a still player).
  - (e) A swipe result line for an on-you grub reads "you swipe: grub hit (1 left)" with no "(on you)" (Q2).
- **AC-29 Cell at an exact half tile (D-014):** practice room, a still player, the grub placed so that it rests (or is spawned) on a half-tile boundary; read the cells in the draws and the words in the text lines. Each at both frame rates; the results must be identical.
  - (a) `player 14.5 4`, `spawn grub 13.5 4`: the draw at 0 s and every later draw while the grub is still shows `g` in the cell immediately left of `P` (x column 14, `P` in column 15). Its "rears back" line says "(left)".
  - (b) `player 8.5 4`, `spawn grub 9.5 4` (right) and `spawn grub 7.5 4` in a second run (left): the first reads "right", the second "left"; neither is ever "on you" and neither is drawn on the other side of `P`.
  - (c) After AC-28(b) the knocked-back grub rests at x 13.5: its glyph stays in the same cell from 0.2 s after the hit until it starts to move, at both rates, and the words in the lines at that time name the same side.
- **AC-30 One meaning of "on you" and of the position words (D-014):**
  - (a) `player 8 4`, `spawn grub 8.2 4`, run to 4 s. In every draw, an enemy within 0.5 tile is called "on you" in every line and in the `on you:` line; no draw has a side word ("left", "right", …) and an `on you:` entry for the same enemy.
  - (b) `player 8.4 4`, grub placed at x 7.8 (0.6 tile left, same cell as `P`): the grub is not on you. It is drawn in the cell left of `P`, every line that names it says "left", and there is no `on you:` entry. A swipe facing right prints "(miss) not in front".
  - (c) In room 2 with a still player, run to 6 s. In every draw, the side word of every text line that names an enemy equals the side of `P` on which that enemy's glyph is drawn in the same draw. This is checked by reading the text, including the 3.38 s and 4.38 s "the grub is open" lines.
  - (d) Hit-line word: in room 2 with a still player, for every "YOU ARE HIT by a grub (…)" line the word equals the word of that grub's "rears back" line, and equals the side/corner of the `G` or `W` in the draw made at its Wind-up start. The 4.3 s hit of the 70 report reads the same word at 30 and 60 FPS (expected: the corner word, "top right").
  - (e) The scripted V-14 case (one grub left, one right, only the right strikes) still reads "(right)", and swapping the strikers swaps the word, at both rates.

### Experience signals (playtest and Review; not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A playtester can say, unprompted, what a grub is about to do before it bites, and describes a reason to move or dash.
- A playtester reacts to a projectile at least once (moves, dashes or approaches a spitter) and can tell the two spitters apart.
- Rooms 4 and 5 are described as different from each other and from rooms 1–3 by what the player does, not only by enemy count.
- The playtester can tell from the screen how many hits an enemy needs.
- Grubs are neither trivial nor unfair: the playtester takes some damage in rooms 4–5 but can explain how it happened. (If grubs read as trivial, or the dash seems unnecessary, retune within D-001.)
- A playtester who stands still can see on the map where the grub that bites them is, including when it is right on top of them.
- A playtester in room 2 does not describe being boxed in by grubs on both sides with no way out.
- A playtester does not say they could not hit a grub that was next to or on them (A3).
- A playtester who hits a grub on top of them sees it step out to the side it was shown on, and does not describe it as jumping to somewhere unexpected.
- A playtester never describes the map and the text lines as saying different things about where a grub is.
- Observed in QA captures (no ruling): an idle player went to zero hearts at about 5.0 s in the practice room and in room 1 before these changes. That is expected for a player who does nothing. After A1 and the engagement cap the idle time to down is expected to be a little different; it is a reference value, not a target. Retune the **[tune]** values from live play.

### Retest guideline (design-side; for the next Play and Review, qualitative)

What a skilled player should be able to do. Numbers belong only in the acceptance criteria above.

- **Room 1 (3 grubs):** a skilled player who reads the cues can clear it and normally keeps most of their hearts. Damage comes from a misread cue or a mistimed dash, not from a bite they could not avoid. They can answer a rear-back by stepping out, by dashing through, or by hitting the winding-up grub, and then punish the open grub. After a hit they can swipe again quickly. A grub right on them can be hit.
- **Room 2 (4 grubs):** a skilled player can break the ring: only two grubs crowd them, bites come one at a time with a gap, and they can dash out to a side or a wall and fight the nearest grub from a free line. The room should still be a real fight where taking a hit or two is plausible, but a player who tries should clear it, usually with at least one heart left. A player who stands still loses; that is meant.
- Judge sameness only on a survived run. A player who cannot clear room 1 or 2 says nothing yet about monotony (see 53 and 54).
- Report from the retest, because they decide the held items: (1) swipes that print "(miss) not in front" while the player aimed at that grub (A4); (2) swipes aimed after a dash that hit air (facing, D1); (3) whether four grubs still arrive as one clump that feels like a wall (D2 / Option B); (4) whether a grub knocked off the player's tile stays in the fight too long, since it keeps its cap slot (D-013).

## Held back or rejected (see D-011, D-013, D-014)

- **A4 cone width 90° → about 120°:** held. It comes in if the retest shows that the "(miss) not in front" line appears on at least 1 in 4 swipes of a reactive session where an enemy was within reach, or that testers report missing grubs standing diagonally in front after A3 is in. Then widen to 120° **[tune]** and add its AC.
- **D1 facing mechanic (turn without moving, auto-face, backstep dash, 360° swipe):** not taken. It goes to `game-director` only if the retest still reports swipes into air after dashes or turning trouble with A3 and the dash-facing rule in.
- **D2 room 1 composition (fewer grubs, staggered arrival):** not taken. A1 and the cap give the intended effect inside Option A.
- **Knockback of an on-tile grub along the player's facing, a fixed direction, or none:** not taken (D-013).
- **Cell-equality "on you", drawn-cell words from raw rounding, hit word from the damage-tick position:** not taken (D-014).

## Open questions

- Reach, cone and projectile speed are design targets. Build reports the as-built values, and Verify may propose changes.
- Glyphs and colors for the new states are chosen in Build and reviewed by the art-director. The art-director may review the choice of the displaced cell for readability (see D-006) and the new wording of V-10, V-12, V-14 and V-18 (D-014).
- The as-built dash distance and the facing behavior after a dash are being checked by QA (55). Where the build differs from the rules above, the rules above stand and QA's result becomes a defect, unless QA shows a rule cannot be built.
- Whether the run has any progression after "run over" is outside this spec.
- If the repo already knocks an on-tile grub in some other direction, the engineer reports it at the next Build; the rule in "Knockback direction" stands.
