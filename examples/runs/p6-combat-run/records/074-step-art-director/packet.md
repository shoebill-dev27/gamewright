## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 69: studio → art-director — Visual review of the changed combat view (V-9…V-17)

## Task

Review what the player sees in the current build against `design/combat-visuals.md` (V-9…V-17, earlier V items as regression) and the project's art direction. Judge readability and consistency, and report pass/fail per V item.

## Context

Goal G-001, "Combat feels monotonous", Option A (D-002). The change set altered the player view: an `on you:` line under the hearts line when an enemy shares the player's tile, a reverse-video cell for the displaced enemy glyph in color mode, hit lines that name the attacker's position or the spitter's spot, and `(miss)` lines with a cause. Your own spec (D-012, V-9…V-17) defines what the view should show. A QA verification of behavior runs in parallel; you review only what the player sees.

## Findings

How to look (from `project.md`; run in `repo/`):

- `python3 play.py --view player {script}` shows what a player sees. Script format is in `manual.md`.
- Useful setups: an enemy on the player's tile (`room empty`, `player 8 4`, `spawn grub 8 4`, then an attack); a room with several grubs; a spitter shot hitting the player; a swipe that misses too far away and one that misses with the enemy not in front.
- Check the color view as well as the plain view, in particular the reverse-video cell and whether it reads against the dark background and keeps the threat colors (saturated orange/red).

Points earlier rounds could not see: the reverse-video cell in color mode, and the `on you:` line in a live frame. Report what you saw first-hand versus what you inferred from code.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: no new inputs.
- D-006: enemies may overlap the player but are never hidden.
- D-012: `on you:` line for displaced enemies; attacker position in hit lines.

## Constraints

- Art direction in `project.md`: warm light against cold blue-black; threats in saturated orange/red.
- You review and specify; do not edit the repo. Changes you want go back as findings.
- Wording placed in `manual.md` is Owner-placed (D-005, D-007); report if V-15 text is missing there, but do not edit it.

## Open questions

None.

## Expected output

A visual review with per-item pass/fail (V-9…V-17, regressions), what was seen first-hand versus inferred, and any specified fixes. Address the result to `studio`.

# Role: Art Director

## Responsibility

Owns visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, and the clarity of everything
the player sees.

## Decides

- Visual direction within the vision: colors, shapes, effects, UI presentation for a change.
- Visual acceptance: whether a change is readable and consistent with the art direction.

## Must not

- Change gameplay rules or parameters — that is `game-designer`.
- Change the art style pillars of the vision — escalate.
- Write production code.

## Works from

- Visual issues from playtests, design specs with visual implications, builds to review.
- The project's art direction and constraints (e.g., asset budget).

## Produces

- Visual spec for a change: what must be visible, how, and visual acceptance criteria.
- Visual review verdict with evidence.

## Hands back / escalates when

- The visual problem is really a rules problem → `game-designer`.
- A style pillar would change → `game-director`, for an Owner escalation.

# Skill: Visual review

Typical roles: art-director.

## When to use

A problem may be visual, or a change affects what the player sees.

## Inputs

The build or captures, the art direction in the Project Context, the spec's visual criteria.

## Method

1. Check readability first: can the player tell what matters (threats, interactables, state) at a
   glance, in every environment and lighting condition the game has?
2. Check consistency with the art direction: palette, shapes, effects, UI style.
3. Check the spec's visual acceptance criteria.
4. Separate visual issues from rule issues; route rule issues to `game-designer`.

## Output

Visual verdict: pass/fail per criterion, readability issues with evidence and where they occur,
consistency notes, proposed visual direction for fixes.

## Do not

Change gameplay rules. Do not judge by personal taste over the project's art direction.

<<<FILE project.md#art-direction
## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

# Combat visuals (build 0.5 target, Option A, G-001)

Status: visual spec and review rulings from the art-director for `design/combat.md`. It changes no rules, timings or parameters. Wherever it names a glyph or color, it covers what `combat.md` leaves to "chosen in Build". Build may change a glyph only if it keeps the rules in this file and documents the change in `manual.md`. V-9 to V-17 and the sections "Enemy on the player's tile" and "Hit lines name the attacker" were added for G-001 handoff 57 (see D-012).

## Intent

The player must be able to tell, from one frame of `run_play` and its text lines, what can hurt them now, what is about to hurt them, and what is open to a counter. Pillar 3: every threat is visible before it can hurt.

## Principles

1. **Glyph first, color second.** The view is text, so every state difference must show in the character or in a text line. Color only reinforces it. Nothing may depend on color alone.
2. **Uppercase means danger.** An uppercase enemy glyph in saturated orange/red means it is committed to hurting the player (Wind-up, Charge, Strike). A lowercase glyph means it is harmless right now.
3. **Orange/red is reserved for threats.** Use it only for telegraphed enemy glyphs and projectiles. The player, the swipe arc and the downed marker never use it. The lantern's warm light and the cold blue-black are the rest of the palette.
4. **The view must catch short telegraphs.** The room is drawn every 0.5 s. The grub Wind-up is exactly 0.5 s, so a frame could fall just before it starts and just after it ends. Draw the room immediately on each of these events, as it already does after a hit:
   - grub Wind-up start
   - spitter Charge start
   - projectile spawn
   - every swipe, including a miss
   - grub Recovery start
   - player down
   These extra draws do not change timing. If Build cannot do this cheaply, report it as an open question to `game-designer`; do not lengthen the telegraphs.

## Glyph table (player view, one cell per tile)

| Thing | State | Glyph | Color | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player | normal | `P` | warm lantern yellow-white | Never orange/red. |
| Player | down | `x` | desaturated cold gray-blue | Replaces `P`. It reads as "out", not as a threat. |
| Grub | Approach / Recovery, full HP | `g` | muted, desaturated warm gray | Harmless. Muted on purpose so the alarming color is saved for the telegraph. |
| Grub | Wind-up / Strike, full HP | `G` | saturated orange/red | The 0.5 s cue. |
| Grub | harmless, damaged (1 HP) | `w` | muted, with a visible tint change from `g` | |
| Grub | Wind-up / Strike, damaged | `W` | saturated orange/red | |
| Spitter | Idle / Recovery / staggered, full HP | `s` | muted, desaturated warm gray | Harmless. |
| Spitter | Charge, full HP | `S` | saturated orange/red | Held for the whole 0.8 s. |
| Spitter | harmless, damaged | `z` | muted, tinted | |
| Spitter | Charge, damaged | `Z` | saturated orange/red | |
| Projectile | in flight | `*` | saturated orange/red, brightest on the map | Visible from spawn to removal. |
| Swipe arc | 0.15 s | `)` facing right, `(` left, `^` up, `v` down, drawn on the tiles in reach | lantern yellow-white | See "Swipe arc". |

Rules:
- Case is the harmless/danger signal and the letter family is the enemy type, so a player learns two things: `g/w` are grubs, `s/z` are spitters.
- A hit on a winding-up grub cancels the wind-up. The glyph must drop to lowercase `w` in the same draw as the hit line.
- A defeated enemy disappears in the draw that prints "defeated".

## Position words (one vocabulary for all lines)

Every line that names where an enemy is uses the same words, relative to the player and taken at the moment the line prints:

- Same tile as the player: `on you`.
- Straight neighbors and further along a straight line: `left`, `right`, `above`, `below`.
- Other positions: the combined form already used for spitters, `top left`, `top right`, `bottom left`, `bottom right`.
- If two enemies of the same type would get the same words in the same draw, add the distance in tiles to both, for example `left, 1 tile` and `left, 3 tiles`. Do not add a distance otherwise, so the lines already praised stay as they are.

## Text lines (telegraph and feedback)

- Every telegraph prints a line at the moment the uppercase glyph appears. The line must say which enemy when more than one can act:
  - grub: "a grub rears back (left)" or "(above)", relative to the player, using the position words above. A grub on the player's tile reads "(on you)". If two grubs wind up on the same draw, print two lines.
  - spitter: "spitter (top right) charges" and "spitter (bottom right) charges", as in the spec.
- Spit lines name the spitter ("spitter (top right) spits"). There are never two identical lines.
- Grub Recovery start prints "the grub is open" with the position words, for example "the grub is open (left)". The 0.9 s counter window is the point of the rework, and in a still frame lowercase `g` looks the same as Approach.
- Swipe result lines follow the spec: "you swipe: grub hit (1 left)", "grub defeated", and the "(miss)", "(too soon)", "(stunned)", "(down)" reasons. They are unchanged by this spec. In the swipe line "(1 left)" is hit points remaining, so no position word is added there.
- Spitter stagger after a hit prints "spitter (top right) is staggered".

## Enemy on the player's tile

D-006 stands: an enemy sharing the player's tile is drawn in the nearest free cell beside the player and is never hidden. That drawn cell is a display offset only. The playtesters read it as the enemy's real position and could not tell which side a bite would come from or where to swing. The fix is a status line that says outright that the enemy is on the player's tile and where it was drawn. The glyphs stay the same and the lines already praised stay the same.

- **On-you line.** In every draw in which one or more enemies share the player's tile, a line `on you:` prints directly under the hearts line, above the room. It lists each such enemy once: its glyph as currently drawn, its state in words, and the cell it was drawn in. Format:
  - `on you: G biting soon (shown right)`
  - `on you: g open (shown below)`
  - with two, separated by `;`: `on you: G biting soon (shown right); g open (shown left)`
  - The state words are `walking`, `biting soon` (Wind-up and Strike), `open` (Recovery), `charging` (spitter Charge), `idle`. Use `biting soon` for both Wind-up and Strike so the line never lags the glyph.
  - `(shown <side>)` uses `left`, `right`, `above`, `below`, which is the cell D-006 chose.
  - When nobody is on the player's tile the line is absent, not blank, so its appearance itself means "something is on you".
- **Meaning of the displaced glyph.** The player reads the glyph beside `P` as "the one named on the `on you:` line" when the line is present. The attacker is on the player's tile, so a bite from it is not coming from the drawn side. The manual says this in one sentence (see V-15).
- **Telling a displaced enemy from a real neighbor.** In a color view the displaced glyph also gets a reverse-video (inverse) cell. This is only a reinforcement, and the on-you line carries the meaning without it. Shape and color of the letter do not change, so V-1, V-4 and V-6 are unaffected.
- **Telegraph and open lines** for an on-tile grub keep the existing wording with "(on you)", for example "a grub rears back (on you)" and "the grub is open (on you)". They print in the same draw in which the on-you line shows the new state.
- **Color.** The on-you line text is lantern-colored, never orange/red. Only the glyph letter inside it takes the glyph's color from the glyph table.
- **Valid under the designer's swipe rule.** This spec makes no claim about which enemies a swipe hits. The on-you line reports where enemies are and their state, whatever the swipe rule is. If a swipe hits a grub on the player's tile, the swipe result lines print as usual, and the enemy's disappearance and the on-you line follow the draw rules below.
- **When the enemy leaves or dies.** The on-you line updates in the same draw as the event that ends the overlap: the swipe that prints "grub defeated", the player's dash, or the grub leaving the tile. The displaced glyph and its line entry do not remain for a later draw.

## Hit lines name the attacker

- When the player loses a heart, the line names the attacker and where it was when the hit landed:
  - grub: `YOU ARE HIT by a grub (left)`, `YOU ARE HIT by a grub (on you)`, `YOU ARE HIT by a grub (above)`.
  - spit shot: `YOU ARE HIT by a spit shot from spitter (top right)`. The position is the spitter's position at the moment of the hit; if the spitter is gone, `YOU ARE HIT by a spit shot`.
- The position words and the ambiguity rule are those of "Position words". With a grub on each side, the line names the side of the grub that actually dealt the damage.
- The line prints in the same draw as the hearts line update, as it does now.
- The grub named in the line must have been an uppercase glyph (Wind-up or Strike) on that position in the draw or draws before the hit. This follows from the telegraph and is what V-14 checks.
- The "hit" case already has its own line, so no second or duplicate line is printed for the same hit. If two grubs are striking on the same draw and only one hit lands, only that one is named.

## Swipe arc

- It is drawn on every swipe, hit or miss, for the 0.15 s of the spec, plus the immediate draw required by principle 4. Without that draw a 0.15 s arc would almost never appear in a 0.5 s frame.
- It covers the tiles inside reach (1.5 tiles, 90° cone) in the facing direction.
- It is lantern-colored, never orange/red, so it is not confused with a threat.
- A miss shows the same arc with "(miss)", so the player sees how far the swipe reached.

## Run-over, down and clear

- **Down:** `x` in the cold gray-blue replaces `P`. The line "you went down" prints. Projectiles disappear in the same draw. The on-you line disappears too, since no enemy acts.
- **Run-over screen:** plain, with nothing else on the map. Lines: "run over — rooms cleared: N", then "press attack to start again". The second line tells the player the restart input and does not change the rule.
- **Room cleared:** "room cleared" prints, projectiles disappear in the same draw, and the hearts line updates. In a scripted session the heal must be visible in the hearts line.
- **Run complete** uses the same screen layout as run-over, with "run complete" instead.

## Visual acceptance criteria

- **V-1** In every draw after a Wind-up or Charge begins, the committed enemy is an uppercase glyph (`G`, `W`, `S`, `Z`). In every harmless state it is lowercase.
- **V-2** The Wind-up start, the Charge start and each swipe have their own draw at that moment, at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- **V-3** At least one draw shows the grub's uppercase glyph before the first heart is lost to it (supports AC-1).
- **V-4** A full-HP and a damaged enemy of the same type can be told apart by glyph in the same state (`g`/`w`, `G`/`W`, `s`/`z`, `S`/`Z`).
- **V-5** `x`, the arc characters and the glyph table are listed in `manual.md#on-screen`.
- **V-6** No color besides the telegraphed enemy glyphs and `*` is saturated orange/red.
- **V-7** The two spitters can be told apart on the screen: each has its own named charge line and its own position.
- **V-8** The run-over screen shows the restart prompt.
- **V-9** (on-you line present) Practice room: `player 8 4` and `spawn grub 8 4`. In every draw in which the grub is on the player's tile, a line starting `on you:` appears under the hearts line and names its glyph, state word and `(shown <side>)`. In every draw in which no enemy is on the player's tile, no `on you:` line appears.
- **V-10** (line matches the picture) In every draw with an `on you:` line, the glyph letter in the line is the letter in the cell beside `P` on the side the line states, and that letter matches the state (uppercase for `biting soon` and `charging`, lowercase for `walking`, `open` and `idle`). Verified by reading the text of the draw, with no color needed.
- **V-11** (real neighbor versus displaced) Practice room: one grub on the player's tile and a second grub on the tile immediately to the player's right. A draw shows both glyphs adjacent to `P` or beside it, and only one of them is named by an `on you:` entry. A reader of the text alone can say which grub is on their tile.
- **V-12** (telegraph from the tile) A grub on the player's tile that winds up prints "a grub rears back (on you)" in the same draw in which its on-you entry changes to `G ... biting soon`. When it enters Recovery, the same holds with "the grub is open (on you)" and `g ... open`.
- **V-13** (hit line names the attacker) Every heart lost to a grub prints `YOU ARE HIT by a grub (<position>)`, and every heart lost to a shot names the spitter or reads "by a spit shot". A hit line is never printed without a position word for a grub.
- **V-14** (which grub) Practice room: one grub left of the player and one right, with only the right one striking. The hit line reads `(right)`. Swapping which grub strikes swaps the word. The position named in the hit line matches the position of an uppercase `G` or `W` in the draw before the hit.
- **V-15** (manual, written by Build) `manual.md#on-screen` lists the `on you:` line and says that a letter beside `P` named on that line is on the player's tile. `manual.md#what-you-hear-and-read` lists the position in the hit line, "(on you)" and the position words.
- **V-16** (both frame rates) V-9 to V-14 hold identically at 30 and 60 FPS. No timing, damage, position or hit test value changes, and no extra draw is added beyond principle 4. The on-you line and the position in the hit line come from the state of the draw that prints them.
- **V-17** (overlap ends) In the draw that prints "grub defeated" for an on-tile grub, and in the draw after a dash off the tile, the on-you entry for that grub and its displaced glyph are gone.

## Experience signals (for playtest and Review)

- A tester told that a grub is on them can say which grub it is, and no longer says the picture is "drawn beside me" with no way to read it.
- With grubs on both sides, a tester can say which one hit them without being told.
- The lines praised in the playtest report ("rears back (left)", the capital and lowercase marks) are still read as before. The new lines do not push them off the screen in room 2 with four grubs around the player.

## Not checked

- Actual colors cannot be assessed from the text view. This spec fixes the intent and the glyph rules. The reverse-video cell for a displaced enemy is a reinforcement that needs a look in a color build. A review of the built player view is still needed.
- Whether the player's hit-invulnerability (0.8 s) and dash invulnerability need a visible cue is left open. Suggestion: `p` (lowercase) for `P` during invulnerability. This needs no rule change, but it is optional and is not in the acceptance criteria.
- The playtester's possibly short warning at 11.90 s to 11.97 s is not a visual finding. The new hit line (V-13, V-14) will make it easier to trace which grub it was, but whether the warning was real is for `qa` and `game-designer`.
- Whether a very crowded tile (three or more enemies on the player's tile) fits one `on you:` line at the room's text width. The spec lists each entry; wrapping to a second line is allowed if needed.

<<<FILE manual.md
# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.5

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears. The room is drawn every half second, and also at the moment of every swipe,
hit, wind-up, charge, shot and other key event.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn. You can move while you swipe.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face. It reaches a little more than one tile in a
  wide cone and hits every enemy inside it. After a swipe you must wait a moment before the next.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face). You cannot be hurt while dashing, and
  you can dash through enemies and shots. It needs a moment to recharge.

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

Hearts are shown above the room. Capital letters mean danger now; small letters mean harmless.

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P` | you |
| `x` | you, down (out of hearts) |
| `g` | grub, harmless right now (walking, or open to a counter) |
| `G` | grub about to bite or biting. Dash or step away. |
| `w` | grub that has been hit once, harmless right now |
| `W` | grub that has been hit once, about to bite or biting |
| `s` | spitter, harmless right now |
| `S` | spitter charging a shot. The shot goes where you stand when the charge ends. |
| `z` | spitter that has been hit once, harmless right now |
| `Z` | spitter that has been hit once, charging a shot |
| `*` | spit shot in flight |
| `)` `(` `^` `v` | your swipe, drawn on the tiles it reaches (right, left, up, down) |

With color on, committed enemies and shots are orange or red, harmless enemies are muted, and you and
your swipe are lantern yellow. The letters carry the meaning without color.

The practice room (`room empty`) is not part of a run. Enemies appear only where your script places them (`spawn`), and you stand where `player` puts you. Nothing heals, there is no next room, and the session ends a moment after you go down. If a grub or spitter is on your tile, it is drawn on a free tile next to you, so you can always see it.

## What you hear and read

- "a grub rears back (left)": that grub is about to bite. Step away or dash.
- "the grub is open": the grub has finished biting; strike now.
- "spitter (top right) charges": that spitter is aiming. Leave the line or dash through it.
- "spitter (top right) spits" / "is staggered": it fired / you hit it mid-charge and it lost its shot.
- "you swipe: grub hit (1 left)", "grub defeated": your swipe result, one line per enemy hit.
- A swipe that does nothing says why: "(miss)" nothing in reach, "(too soon)" you are still
  recovering from the last swipe, "(stunned)" you were just hit, "(down)" you are out of hearts.
- A dash on cooldown says "(dash not ready)".

## Rooms and runs

- Hearts carry from room to room. Clearing a room ("room cleared") heals one heart, up to three.
  You can move and swipe for a moment, then the next room begins.
- Clearing room 5 ends the run with "run complete".
- At zero hearts you are down: enemies stop and shots vanish. A moment later the screen reads "run
  over — rooms cleared: N" and "press attack to start again". Attack starts a new run from room 1
  with full hearts.
- The practice room (`room empty`) is not a run: nothing heals, there is no next room, and the
  session ends a moment after you go down.

# D-006: Enemies may overlap the player but are never hidden; the practice room is listed in the On screen section

## Decision

1. **Overlap (F1).** Enemies and the player still have no collision. A grub may end a lunge or recovery within the player's tile, and the player may walk or dash onto an enemy. In the player view no enemy is hidden under `P`: an enemy sharing the player's cell is drawn in the nearest free cell beside the player (display offset only). Timings, hit tests, damage and positions are unchanged. Order of preference: the side it last came from, then right, left, above, below.
2. **AC-15.** The body text is binding: `x` and the practice room must both be listed in `manual.md#on-screen`. AC-15 in `design/combat.md` now says so.

## Rationale

- Pillar 3 requires every threat to be visible before it hurts. The telegraph convention needs an on-map change, which is lost when the glyph hides under `P`.
- A display rule is cheap and does not touch the tuned grub cycle. Keeping them apart would need collision or pushing rules and would change timings and the dash-through behavior (the dash passes through enemies by design).
- Showing the glyph in all states, not only in the telegraph, also helps the Recovery counter window, the point of Option A.
- The player reads the manual's On screen section for what marks mean. A practice room that is not listed there is hard to find, and the body text is the more specific statement of intent.

## Alternatives considered

- **Forbid overlap (separation or collision):** rejected; it changes timing and positioning rules and conflicts with the dash passing through enemies.
- **Draw the enemy over `P` when committed:** rejected; the player would vanish from the map when it matters most.
- **Change the player glyph on overlap:** rejected; it hides the enemy's position and state.
- **Keep the AC wording as the binding text:** rejected; it leaves the practice room undocumented where players look.

## Revisit when

- A playtest shows the displaced glyph is misread as the enemy's true position.
- Option B or movement changes make overlap common enough to justify a collision rule.

# D-012: Mark an enemy on the player's tile with an `on you:` line, and name the attacker's position in hit lines

## Decision

1. D-006 stands. An enemy sharing the player's tile is still drawn in the nearest free cell beside the player, and it is still never hidden.
2. When any enemy is on the player's tile, an `on you:` line under the hearts line names each one (glyph, state, and the cell it is drawn in). The line is absent when nobody is on the tile. In a color view the displaced glyph's cell is also reverse-video as a reinforcement.
3. Hit lines name the attacker and its position at the moment of the hit ("YOU ARE HIT by a grub (left)"). Position words are shared with the telegraph lines. A distance is added only where two enemies of the same type would otherwise get identical words.
4. Details and acceptance criteria are `design/combat-visuals.md` (V-9 to V-17).

## Rationale

- Two playtesters in two sessions could not tell which side a bite would come from or which grub hit them (G-001, handoff 57). Pillar 3 asks that threats be readable.
- A one-cell-per-tile text view has no room for a second mark on the same tile, so the clarity has to come from a text line. Principle 1 already allows state to be carried in text.
- It changes only display. No rule, timing or parameter changes. It reuses the existing glyphs, the "(on you)" wording and the position words, so the praised lines stay as they are.
- It does not depend on the designer's pending swipe rule. The line reports position and state, not what a swipe will hit.

## Alternatives considered

- **Change the glyph on overlap (a separate "overlap" glyph or marker character):** rejected. It drops the enemy's case-coded state, which is the reading players praised, and D-006 rejected a similar idea.
- **Replace `P` while an enemy is on the tile:** rejected in D-006. The player would vanish from the map.
- **Rely on reverse-video or color only:** rejected. Principle 1 forbids meaning that depends on color alone, and it cannot be verified from the text view.
- **Make the map wider (two cells per tile) to show the overlap side by side:** rejected for now. It reflows the room and the tests, and it is not a small change for a small team.
- **Only add "(on you)" to hit lines:** rejected. It does not help when the enemy is beside the player in the picture, which was the reported confusion.

## Revisit when

- A playtest after the build shows the player still misreads the drawn side, or the `on you:` line is not read.
- Overlap becomes frequent enough (Option B, movement changes, or the designer's swipe rule) that the line is on screen most of the time and adds noise.
- The view moves beyond text and glyphs, so a real overlap marker on the tile becomes possible.

# 60: art-director → studio — Visual spec for "on you" and "which grub hit you" (V-9 to V-17)

## Task

Route the visual spec in `design/combat-visuals.md` (new items V-9 to V-17) to Build with the designer's spec change from 56, then to Verify. The display must show when a grub is on the player's tile and which grub dealt a hit.

## Context

G-001 (combat monotony), Option A. Two playtesters in two sessions reported the same two confusions (from 57 and the report in 54):
- A grub on the player's tile ("the grub is open (on you)") is drawn beside the player (D-006), and the player could not tell which side the bite would come from or where to swing.
- "YOU ARE HIT by a grub" does not say which grub when several are around. Rooms 1 and 2 often have two to four close together.

The capital and lowercase marks and the "rears back (left)" lines were praised. They are kept unchanged.

## Findings

What the spec adds (all display and text; no rule, timing or parameter changed):

1. **`on you:` line** under the hearts, present only while an enemy shares the player's tile. It lists each such enemy with its glyph, a state word (`walking`, `biting soon`, `open`, `charging`, `idle`) and the cell it is drawn in, for example `on you: G biting soon (shown right)`. It answers the first open question: the displaced glyph is marked by text, and a reverse-video cell reinforces it in a color view. No glyph changes.
2. **Position in hit lines**: `YOU ARE HIT by a grub (left)`, `... (on you)`, or `... by a spit shot from spitter (top right)`. It answers the second open question. It uses the same position words as the existing lines. A distance in tiles is added only when two enemies of the same type would get identical words.
3. **Same position words for the "is open" line**: "the grub is open (left)", "(on you)".
4. **Order and timing**: no new draws beyond the existing principle 4; the on-you line and the hit position come from the state of the draw that prints them. They hold at 30 and 60 FPS.
5. **D-012** records the choice. D-006 is not reversed.

The spec's wording makes no claim about which enemies a swipe hits, so it stays valid whatever swipe rule 56 settles. Only the swipe result lines depend on that rule, and this spec leaves them unchanged.

## Decisions already made

- D-006: enemies may overlap the player but are never hidden; display offset only. Stands.
- D-012: `on you:` line and attacker position in hit lines (new, art-director).

## Constraints

- Visual and text changes only. If Build finds that naming the attacker needs a rule or timing change, hand back to `game-designer`.
- `manual.md` is not written by the art-director or by Build. The Owner places manual text (D-005, D-007 pattern); the Studio routes the V-15 text (`manual.md#on-screen`, `manual.md#what-you-hear-and-read`) to the Owner (62). (Corrected by the Studio at Route; the original said Build updates `manual.md`.)
- Art direction: orange/red only for telegraphed glyphs and projectiles. The on-you line text and the hit lines are lantern-colored, not orange/red. Only the glyph letter inside the on-you line uses its glyph color.

## Open questions

- **For Build:** Does the hit event know which grub dealt the damage, and where it was when the hit landed? V-13 and V-14 need that. If it is only known in the trace and not in the player-view event, say so; it is a Build question, not a rule change.
- **For Build:** Can the player view print one extra line under the hearts and give a displaced cell inverse video? If a plain view cannot, the line alone still meets V-9 to V-11.
- **For `game-designer` (informational):** the swipe rule in 56 should be reflected in the swipe result lines only. If a swipe that hits an on-tile grub should print "(on you)" in its line, the designer should say so; the visual spec does not require it.
- **For `qa`:** The possibly short bite warning at 11.90 s to 11.97 s in report 54 is not a visual issue. The new hit lines will help trace which grub it was.

## Expected output

- Build: implement V-9 to V-17 in the player view with the designer's spec. `manual.md` is placed by the Owner, not by Build.
- Verify (`qa`): check V-9 to V-17 by scripted sessions in the practice room, for example `player 8 4` with `spawn grub 8 4`, and a grub on the left and right with only one striking, at both `fps 30` and `fps 60`.
- Review: the experience signals at the end of the "Experience signals" section in `design/combat-visuals.md`. A visual review of the built view is still needed for the real colors.

## Sender assessment

I am fairly confident in the text-line approach. It is cheap, testable from the plain view and independent of the swipe rule. The least certain parts are whether a single `on you:` line stays readable with three or more enemies on the tile, and whether the hit event can name the attacker. Both are listed as open and are cheap to settle in Build.
