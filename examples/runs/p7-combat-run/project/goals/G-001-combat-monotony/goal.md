# G-001: Combat feels monotonous

## Owner request

> 戦闘が単調なので改善したい

## Interpretation

Success condition (qualitative): a player playing the current build's combat experiences it as varied and engaging instead of monotonous. Different situations call for noticeably different play (positioning, timing, use of attack and dash), and the player can tell why. The improvement stays inside the vision pillars: one-button combat (attack + dash only, D-001), short runs, readable threats. Numeric thresholds belong to Design; the final verdict belongs to Review.

Out of scope: new input buttons (needs Owner approval per D-001), changing run length, new biomes or content unrelated to combat variety, and any change to the core concept. Not a defect report: nothing in the request says combat is broken.

## Unknowns

- Observe: done (02; QA 16, 20, 32, 36, 56, 64). Contact-edge graze accepted (D-002, D-003). 30 FPS player view and late-swipe boundary match the design (64). No open defect.
- Diagnose: two passes done (04, 31); a third is barred by the loop limit. Review 67 found no new cause.
- Decide: skipped. Review pass 2 (67, D-010) found the D-009 escalation condition not met. Row 11 (Owner escalation) stays tentative: only if Review pass 3 says the melee still reads as one fight.
- Design: D-004 to D-007 stand. Room 3 in-flight question settled by D-007 (68); D-011 accepted (variant-named wind-up and hit messages, supersedes D-008). Open: room 3 variety, a single ask and a long standoff against one cornered spitter (70).
- Plan: skipped (approach local). Returns if the same criterion fails verification twice.
- Build: 0.6.1 done (48). Build 22a open (69): D-011 messages and manual wording. A later Build only if 22b specifies a room 3 change.
- Verify (QA): pass on 0.6.1 at 30 and 60 FPS (50, 64). Any new build needs Verify. Visual V1–V11 need a graphical build, a proposed new Goal at Close; V12 open.
- Play: three scripted passes done (27, 53, 63). Rooms 4–5 varied and engaging; room 3 and the slow-run brute loop repetitive; brute/runner messages read "a grub". Next: a fresh playtest of the new build, ideally live or hand-timed, with the playtest brief stating the build.
- Review: pass 1 (60) and pass 2 (67) done, both goal-not-met; the gap is narrow. Pass 3 follows the next playtest.

## Route changes

After 21a/21b (67, 68): Review pass 2 is goal-not-met with a narrow gap and no Owner escalation (D-010). Design kept D-007 for room 3 in-flight and accepted D-011 (variant-named messages). Opened Build 22a (69: D-011, manual text) and, in parallel, Design 22b (70: room 3 variety). A room 3 Build follows only if 22b specifies one; then Verify, fresh playtest, Review pass 3.

## Next action

Run in parallel: `gameplay-engineer` with 69-studio-to-gameplay-engineer.md and `game-designer` with 70-studio-to-game-designer.md (both address the result to `studio`). Then Route: if 22b specifies a room 3 change, open Build 23 (and Verify after both builds); otherwise open Verify 24 (QA, Sender assessment stripped) on the 22a build. Then a fresh playtest (25) stating the build number, and Review pass 3 (26). Escalate to the Owner only if Review pass 3 says the melee still reads as one fight (D-009).

## Outcome
