## You may write

- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/08-qa-to-<recipient>.md
- @run/<tests|play|trace|bots>[/<label>]: instead of your final files, up to 3 times: one block per run, holding its input script for a command with {script} (empty otherwise), plus any repo/ files you may write that the run should use. A new executor gets the results and must write every file to keep in its final answer

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 06: studio → qa — Reproduce the 30 vs 60 FPS difference in bot results and check dash invulnerability

## Task

Reproduce and report whether the build behaves differently at 30 and 60 FPS, using the balance bots, and check that the dash invulnerability in the build matches `design/combat.md`.

## Context

Goal G-001 is about improving combat variety. Before combat is changed, the team needs to know whether the current build plays correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS, which is a project constraint. A team member observed a discrepancy when running the bots. No change to the build is wanted in this step.

## Findings

Reported observation (not yet reproduced or explained), from `run_bots` over rooms 1–5 at both rates:

- The dodger bot (uses dashes), room 3: at 60 FPS it failed (19.7 s, 13 dashes, 3 hearts lost). At 30 FPS it cleared (9.5 s, 0 hearts lost, 4 dashes).
- The dodger bot, room 4: 21.8 s at 60 FPS and 17.8 s at 30 FPS.
- The walker and camper bots gave the same results at both rates.

It is not known whether the difference comes from the build or from how the bot works.

## Decisions already made

None.

## Constraints

- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS (project.md#constraints).
- Do not change the build or the bots. Report only.
- `run_bots` takes a script argument; see `repo/README.md`, `repo/manual.md` and `repo/bots.py` for the correct format and how to set the frame rate. Earlier attempts with a wrong script format produced no output.
- Also use `run_trace` and `run_tests`. Report reproducibility, the conditions needed to reproduce it, and severity.

## Open questions

- Is the difference reproducible, and is it deterministic (same result on repeated runs)?
- Does the simulation itself (enemy timing, shot timing, damage, dash duration, cooldown) differ between 30 and 60 FPS, or only the bot's decisions?
- Does the dash make the player invulnerable for its full duration in the build, as `design/combat.md` says, at both rates?

## Expected output

A defect report (or a report that nothing reproduces) with reproduction steps, observed vs expected behavior and acceptance criteria if a defect is confirmed. If it cannot be determined whether the build or the bot is at fault, say so and state what was ruled out. Write the outgoing Handoff addressed to `studio`.

# Role: QA

## Responsibility

Reproduces defects and independently verifies that built changes meet their acceptance criteria
without breaking existing behavior.

## Decides

- Pass or fail against the acceptance criteria, with evidence.
- Whether a defect is reproducible, and its severity.

## Must not

- Modify the production code under verification. QA may add or run tests and test tooling.
- Redefine acceptance criteria, or pass a change with a known failing criterion.
- Decide intended behavior when the spec is silent — hand back to `game-designer`.

## Independence

Verify from the spec, the acceptance criteria and the build — not from the engineer's explanation
of why it should work. Prefer a fresh executor context without the implementation history.

## Works from

- For defects: the Owner's report and the relevant design documents.
- For verification: acceptance criteria, how to exercise the change, project constraints (e.g.,
  supported platforms and frame rates).
- Never the implementer's self-assessment or reasoning: a Handoff's `## Sender assessment` section
  is removed before QA receives it.

## Produces

- A defect report: reproduction steps, expected vs actual (with the source of "expected"),
  conditions, severity, acceptance criteria for the fix.
- A verification report: per-criterion pass/fail with evidence, regressions checked.

## Hands back / escalates when

- Verification fails → `gameplay-engineer`, with the failure report.
- The expected behavior is undefined → `game-designer`.
- The same criterion fails a second time → Studio routes to `technical-director`.

# Skill: Reproduce defect

Typical roles: qa. Any Role whose responsibility covers confirming a defect may use it.

## When to use

A problem is reported but has not been reproduced first-hand, or its conditions are unclear.

## Inputs

The report, how to run the build, the design documents that define expected behavior, the
project's supported platforms and settings.

## Method

1. Reproduce exactly as reported. Then vary one condition at a time (timing, input device, frame
   rate, platform, state) to find the minimal reliable steps and the boundary where it stops.
2. Name the source of "expected": cite the design document or Decision. If no source defines the
   expected behavior, it is a spec gap, not a defect — say so and hand back to `game-designer`.
3. Rate severity from the player's view (blocks progress / hurts the experience / cosmetic) and
   frequency.
4. Write acceptance criteria for the fix: observable checks, including the conditions you varied.

## Output

Defect report: steps, expected (with source), actual, conditions and boundary, severity, frequency,
acceptance criteria, evidence (logs, recordings, notes).

## Do not

Guess at code-level causes as fact; label any hypothesis as one. Do not fix the defect.
>>>END

<<<FILE project.md#constraints
## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

# Combat design (build 0.5 target, specified in G-001 step 07)

Status: Grub, Spitter and room changes below are SPEC for the next build. The player kit is unchanged from 0.4.

## Intent

Every threat is visible before it can hurt, and every threat has an answer other than "stand and swing". Walking straight into a fight without reading it should cost hearts. Reading the cue and using a sidestep or the dash should cost fewer. Grub rooms should differ from each other, and the dash should be worth using.

## Player kit (unchanged)

- **Attack** (one button): a short swipe in the facing direction, reach 1.5 tiles. 1 damage. 0.35 s recovery.
- **Dash**: 4 tiles over 0.25 s. The player is invulnerable for the full dash duration. Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends.
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, 0.3 s hit-stun (no input), then invulnerability until 0.8 s after the hit.
- Player speed 4 tiles/s. 3 hearts per room. No new inputs (D-001).

## Timing rule (applies to everything below)

All durations are in seconds and run on accumulated time, not frame counts, so 30 and 60 FPS behave the same. Per-frame travel of a lunging grub (at most 8/30 = 0.27 tile) and of a shot (at most 3.0/30 = 0.1 tile) stays below the contact reach (0.6 and 0.4), so nothing tunnels through the player at 30 FPS.

## Enemies

### Grub (A): three-phase attack with a telegraph

Phases:

1. **Approach.** Walks straight at the player at the grub's speed. Bites on contact only during the lunge (see below). Walking alone does not damage. Replaces the old "contact bite while walking".
2. **Wind-up** (starts when the player is within 2.0 tiles and no other grub is in wind-up or lunge).
   - The grub stops.
   - The aim direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the wind-up.
   - Visible cue for the whole wind-up duration: the grub flashes saturated orange-red and a thin orange-red line shows the lunge path (length equal to the lunge distance).
   - Text view: message "a grub rears back" when it starts.
   - Cue visible at least 0.5 s before the hit for the standard grub. The player has time to step out of the line, because player speed is 4 tiles/s and the line is 0.6 tiles to either side.
3. **Lunge.** Moves along the locked direction at lunge speed for the lunge time (distance 2.4 tiles). It stops early on contact with the player. If the player is inside reach 0.6 and not invulnerable, it deals 1 damage (once per lunge).
4. **Recovery.** The grub is stationary and unthreatening for the recovery time, then returns to Approach. This is the safe window to swipe it.

Rules:

- A swipe that damages a grub in wind-up cancels the wind-up. The grub is staggered (no action) for 0.4 s, then returns to Approach.
- A grub that is hit but not killed during lunge or recovery continues its phase.
- At most one grub is in wind-up or lunge at a time. Others keep walking and wait. This prevents simultaneous unavoidable lunges.
- The player's dash invulnerability stops the damage. The lunge is not cancelled. The grub finishes the lunge, wherever it ends, then does its recovery.
- Hurt-invulnerability (0.8 s) also stops the damage the same way.
- A lunge is clamped at the room edge like all movement.
- If the player is dead or the room is cleared, grubs stop.

Parameters (Grub is one type, with parameter sets only; same behavior and same code path):

| Variant | Mark (text) | HP | Walk speed (tiles/s) | Wind-up (s) | Lunge speed (tiles/s) / time (s) | Recovery (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard grub | `g` | 2 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.8 |
| Runner grub | `r` | 1 | 1.6 | 0.35 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.6 |
| Brute grub | `G` | 4 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 1.2 |

Tuning range allowed to engineering and QA without a new spec (if bots or play need it): wind-up 0.35–0.7 s for any variant. Never below 0.35 s.

### Spitter (B): staggered, with an aim cue

- **Aim cue.** 0.6 s before each shot the spitter glows saturated orange-red, growing brighter. The shot direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the cue. The direction is shown as a thin orange-red line for the 0.6 s of the cue. Text view: "a spitter takes aim" at the start of the cue and "a spitter spits" at the shot. The shot is then fired along the locked line.
- **Shot.** Speed 3.0 tiles/s (was 1.6). It travels in a straight line, does 1 damage, and disappears at the room edge, on contact with the player, or after 5 s. Dash invulnerability and hurt-invulnerability stop the damage as now.
- **Interval and stagger.** Fire interval 2.4 s (was 2.0 s). The first shot of the k-th spitter in room order (k = 0, 1, 2…) is at 1.8 s + 0.8 s × k. After that each spitter fires every 2.4 s from its own start. With three spitters, shots are 0.8 s apart.
- **Cap.** At most 3 shots in flight in the room. A spitter that would start a cue while 3 shots are in flight waits 0.2 s and checks again.
- **HP** 2, stationary, and can be swiped at any time. No change.

## Rooms (C: light pass, existing enemies and parameter variants only)

5 rooms, 3–6 enemies each. A room ends when all enemies are defeated. Positions are (x, y) in tiles.

| Room | Contents (changes from 0.4 in bold) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Standard grubs at (3,4), (15,4), (8,0) (unchanged) | Teach the lunge cue against one grub at a time |
| 2 | **Runner (2,1), Runner (1,8), Brute (15,7), Standard (14,0)** | Different from room 1: fast fragile ones plus a slow tough one, from four corners |
| 3 | Spitters at (2,1), (14,7), (2,7) (unchanged), with the new stagger and cue | Learn the aim cue |
| 4 | **Runner (1,4)**, Standard (0,1), Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Grub lunges under fire |
| 5 | Standard (1,1), Standard (0,6), **Brute (4,8)**, Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Hardest, most threats at once |

Rooms 4–5 were read from the room data in the repo; no human has seen them yet.

## Acceptance criteria

### Verifiable (QA, with `play` and `bots`)

Scripts below use the practice room (`room empty`, `spawn`, `player`), so they work at both `fps 30` and `fps 60`. Every check holds at BOTH rates.

Grub:

1. **Telegraph.** A standard grub within 2.0 tiles of a stationary player shows the wind-up message and the cue. The hit lands no earlier than 0.5 s after the cue first appears, ±1 frame.
2. **Sidestep works.** A player who moves 1 tile sideways (up or down relative to the grub's line) within 0.4 s after the cue appears takes no damage from that lunge.
3. **Dash works.** A dash started at any point from the cue until 0.1 s before the lunge ends takes no damage, and the dash is not "ignored".
4. **Standing still is punished.** A player who does nothing for 3 s next to a standard grub loses at least 1 heart.
5. **Safe window.** During recovery the grub does not damage the player on contact.
6. **Cancel.** Two swipes kill a standard grub. A swipe that lands during wind-up stops the lunge.
7. **One at a time.** With 3 grubs close together, no two grubs are in wind-up or lunge at the same moment.
8. **Variants.** Runner dies to one swipe, brute to four. Marks `r` and `G` appear in the text view and are listed in the manual.

Spitter:

9. **Cue.** The cue and message appear 0.6 s ±1 frame before each shot, and the shot is fired along the locked line.
10. **Dodge works.** A player who moves aside by 1 tile within 0.4 s after the cue appears is not hit by that shot.
11. **Stagger.** In room 3 the first shots are at 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s ±1 frame. Never more than 3 shots in flight.

Rooms and bots:

12. **Rooms differ.** The contents match the table above.
13. **Walker vs dodger (bot result).** In rooms 3–5, summed over those three rooms, the walker (never dashes) loses at least 3 hearts and at most 6. A dodger that reacts to cues and dashes well loses at most half of the walker's total, and clears 3/3. The walker still clears at least 2 of rooms 3–5. The camper clears fewer rooms than the walker.
14. **Grub rooms.** In rooms 1–2 the walker loses at least 1 heart in total, and clears both rooms.
15. **Dash is used.** The good dodger uses at least 1 dash in each of rooms 3–5.
16. The results in 13–15 hold at 30 AND at 60 FPS.

**Dependency on the bots' FPS behavior:** criteria 13–16 assume the bots behave the same at 30 and 60 FPS. QA is checking that now: the existing dodger failed room 3 at 60 FPS and cleared it at 30 FPS, and the cause is unknown. The existing `bots.py` bots do not react to the new cues (wind-up, aim line), so the "good dodger" in 13 needs a bot update or a reaction-rule script. Until QA reconciles this, criteria 1–12 are the ones that stand alone; 13–16 are conditional.

### Experience signals (playtest and Review, not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A player can say, before it hits, that a grub is about to lunge and from where.
- A player can say why they got hit by a shot ("I didn't move") rather than "it came out of nowhere".
- Rooms 1 and 2 are described as different fights.
- The dash is used on purpose at least once in a room, not only in panic.

## Edge cases

- Dash through a wind-up or lunge: see Grub rules. The grub finishes its phase in place.
- Two shots arriving together: the player takes at most 1 damage per hit-invulnerability window as now.
- Player dies mid-lunge or mid-cue: enemies stop (existing end-of-session handling).
- Last enemy killed during its wind-up: room cleared as usual.
- A spitter killed during its cue cancels the shot. Shots already in flight continue.
- A spitter at the player's exact position (distance 0): no aim line and no shot (as now, no shot when dist is 0).
- Shot locked on a player who then left the room line: the shot continues straight and disappears at the edge.

## Open questions

- Whether bots (walker, dodger) need rewriting to read the cue, and whether the new numbers keep criterion 13 inside range. This needs bot runs after Build.
- Art cue details (flash, line, glow): `art-director` after Build.
- Whether the text view's `r` / `G` marks suit the graphical build.

## Changed since 0.4

Grub behavior, Spitter timing and cue, rooms 2, 4, 5. Manual (`repo/manual.md`) must list the new marks and messages.

# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.4

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears, with the room drawn every half second and after every hit.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face).

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |
| `when <condition> then <action>` | A reaction rule (below). |

## Reactions

Instead of (or as well as) timed inputs, you can play by reacting to what is on screen. Each frame
the rules are checked from the top; the first one whose condition holds acts. A rule acts at most
every 0.15 s, like a player's reaction time, so the next rule down can act meanwhile. A session
with rules runs until the room is cleared or you go down (at most 60 s), unless `end` says
otherwise.

| Condition | Holds when |
|---|---|
| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see g within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile. Hearts are shown above the room.

<!-- Self-contained: the recipient (any executor, any session) starts from this file and its Load

checks it against the recipient's "Works from", settles Expected output and fills Load when routing.
