## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 12: studio → art-director — Review the new combat cues for readability (build 0.5)

## Task

Review the threat cues added in build 0.5 against the art direction and the "readable threats" pillar. The build is a headless text view, so judge what the cues must look like in a graphical build, and report concrete requirements or problems.

## Context

G-001 (combat monotony). The combat redesign adds telegraphed attacks so the player can read a threat and respond (dash, sidestep, swipe). The cues are new visuals. QA verifies behavior separately; you judge readability and consistency.

## Findings

Cues as they appear in the player view (`run_play`):
- **Grub wind-up (0.5 s before the lunge):** a line `a grub rears back`, plus a snapshot where the lunge path is a row of `~` marks (2.4 tiles) from the grub along the locked direction. Under the room: `cue: g at (x,y) flashes orange-red, lunge line toward (ux,uy), 2.4 tiles (0.50 s to the lunge)`. Variants: Runner (mark `r`) and Brute (mark `G`) have different wind-up lengths per `design/combat.md`.
- **Spitter aim (0.6 s before the shot):** `a spitter takes aim`, `~` marks along the locked line to the room edge, and `cue: s at (x,y) glows orange-red, brightness NN%, aim line toward (ux,uy) (0.60 s to the shot)`. Brightness rises from 0% to 100%. Then `a spitter spits` and the shot `*` moves along the line.
- The flash, glow and line are described only in text. Color and look are not rendered.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: one attack button plus dash.
- Art direction (project.md): dark caves lit by the player's lantern, warm light against cold blue-black; threats use saturated orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Constraints

- Small team: prefer requirements that reuse existing assets and effects.
- Threats must be visible before they can hurt the player (pillar 3). Multiple enemies can be on screen, so cues must stay distinguishable from each other, from shots, and from the lantern light.
- Do not change timings or rules; those belong to the game-designer. If a readability problem needs a timing or rule change, say so in your report.

## Open questions

1. Are the cue forms (flash, lunge line, aim line, glow ramp) readable and consistent with the art direction? Any clash or ambiguity (e.g. lunge line vs aim line vs shot)?
2. What must a graphical implementation satisfy (contrast, shape, duration visibility, differentiating Runner/Grub/Brute and spitter), stated player-observably?

## Expected output

A report with findings and player-observable visual requirements or acceptance criteria. Address the result to `studio`. Do not change the game design files unless your findings name them.

# Role: Art Director

## Responsibility

Owns visual expression and visual consistency: style, readability, and the clarity of everything
the player sees.

## Decides

- Visual direction within the vision: colors, shapes, effects, UI presentation for a change.
- Visual acceptance: whether a change is readable and consistent with the art direction.

## Must not

- Change gameplay rules or parameters — that is `game-designer`.
- Change the art style pillars of the vision — escalate.
- Write production code.

## Works from

- Visual issues from playtests, design specs with visual implications, builds to review.
- The project's art direction and constraints (e.g., asset budget).

## Produces

- Visual spec for a change: what must be visible, how, and visual acceptance criteria.
- Visual review verdict with evidence.

## Hands back / escalates when

- The visual problem is really a rules problem → `game-designer`.
- A style pillar would change → `game-director`, for an Owner escalation.

# Skill: Visual review

Typical roles: art-director.

## When to use

A problem may be visual, or a change affects what the player sees.

## Inputs

The build or captures, the art direction in the Project Context, the spec's visual criteria.

## Method

1. Check readability first: can the player tell what matters (threats, interactables, state) at a
   glance, in every environment and lighting condition the game has?
2. Check consistency with the art direction: palette, shapes, effects, UI style.
3. Check the spec's visual acceptance criteria.
4. Separate visual issues from rule issues; route rule issues to `game-designer`.

## Output

Visual verdict: pass/fail per criterion, readability issues with evidence and where they occur,
consistency notes, proposed visual direction for fixes.

## Do not

Change gameplay rules. Do not judge by personal taste over the project's art direction.

# Combat design (build 0.5, specified in G-001 step 07, rulings in step 14)

Status: Build 0.5 implements the Grub, Spitter and room changes below. Step 14 settled criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps (marked "step 14" in the text). The player kit is unchanged from 0.4.

## Intent

Every threat is visible before it can hurt, and every threat has an answer other than "stand and swing". Walking straight into a fight without reading it should cost hearts. Reading the cue and using a sidestep or the dash should cost fewer. Grub rooms should differ from each other, and the dash should be worth using.

## Player kit (unchanged)

- **Attack** (one button): a short swipe in the facing direction, reach 1.5 tiles. 1 damage. 0.35 s recovery.
- **Dash**: 4 tiles over 0.25 s. The player is invulnerable for the full dash duration. Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends.
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, 0.3 s hit-stun (no input), then invulnerability until 0.8 s after the hit.
- Player speed 4 tiles/s. 3 hearts per room. No new inputs (D-001).

## Timing rule (applies to everything below)

All durations are in seconds and run on accumulated time, not frame counts, so 30 and 60 FPS behave the same. Per-frame travel of a lunging grub (at most 8/30 = 0.27 tile) and of a shot (at most 3.0/30 = 0.1 tile) stays below the contact reach (0.6 and 0.4), so nothing tunnels through the player at 30 FPS.

## Enemies

### Grub (A): three-phase attack with a telegraph

Phases:

1. **Approach.** Walks straight at the player at the grub's speed. Bites on contact only during the lunge (see below). Walking alone does not damage. Replaces the old "contact bite while walking".
2. **Wind-up** (starts when the player is within 2.0 tiles and no other grub is in wind-up or lunge).
   - The grub stops.
   - The aim direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the wind-up.
   - **Step 14:** if the grub is exactly on the player (distance 0), the locked direction is right (+x). The cue and line are shown as usual.
   - Visible cue for the whole wind-up duration: the grub flashes saturated orange-red and a thin orange-red line shows the lunge path (length equal to the lunge distance).
   - Text view: message "a grub rears back" when it starts.
   - Cue visible at least 0.5 s before the hit for the standard grub. The player has time to step out of the line, because player speed is 4 tiles/s and the line is 0.6 tiles to either side.
3. **Lunge.** Moves along the locked direction at lunge speed for the lunge time (distance 2.4 tiles). It stops early on contact with the player. If the player is inside reach 0.6 and not invulnerable, it deals 1 damage (once per lunge).
4. **Recovery.** The grub is stationary and unthreatening for the recovery time, then returns to Approach. This is the safe window to swipe it.

Rules:

- A swipe that damages a grub in wind-up cancels the wind-up. The grub is staggered (no action) for 0.4 s, then returns to Approach.
- **Step 14:** a swipe that kills a grub does not stagger it. The grub is simply defeated (in wind-up too).
- **Step 14:** a grub that is hit but not killed during Approach, Lunge, Recovery or Stagger continues its phase unchanged. Only a hit during wind-up changes its phase, and a hit during stagger does not extend the stagger.
- At most one grub is in wind-up or lunge at a time. Others keep walking and wait. This prevents simultaneous unavoidable lunges.
- The player's dash invulnerability stops the damage. The lunge is not cancelled. The grub finishes the lunge, wherever it ends, then does its recovery.
- Hurt-invulnerability (0.8 s) also stops the damage the same way.
- A lunge is clamped at the room edge like all movement.
- If the player is dead or the room is cleared, grubs stop.

Consequence worth knowing when reading bot results: a wind-up always comes before the first contact. A player who ignores the cue and does not move takes one lunge per grub (1 heart each), then gets the recovery window to swipe it.

Parameters (Grub is one type, with parameter sets only; same behavior and same code path):

| Variant | Mark (text) | HP | Walk speed (tiles/s) | Wind-up (s) | Lunge speed (tiles/s) / time (s) | Recovery (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard grub | `g` | 2 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.8 |
| Runner grub | `r` | 1 | 1.6 | 0.35 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.6 |
| Brute grub | `G` | 4 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 1.2 |

Tuning range allowed to engineering and QA without a new spec (if bots or play need it): wind-up 0.35–0.7 s for any variant. Never below 0.35 s.

### Spitter (B): staggered, with an aim cue

- **Aim cue.** 0.6 s before each shot the spitter glows saturated orange-red, growing brighter. The shot direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the cue. The direction is shown as a thin orange-red line for the 0.6 s of the cue. Text view: "a spitter takes aim" at the start of the cue and "a spitter spits" at the shot. The shot is then fired along the locked line.
- **Shot.** Speed 3.0 tiles/s (was 1.6). It travels in a straight line, does 1 damage, and disappears at the room edge, on contact with the player, or after 5 s. Dash invulnerability and hurt-invulnerability stop the damage as now.
- **Interval and stagger.** Fire interval 2.4 s (was 2.0 s). The first shot of the k-th spitter in room order (k = 0, 1, 2…) is at 1.8 s + 0.8 s × k. After that each spitter fires every 2.4 s after its previous shot. With three spitters, shots are 0.8 s apart.
- **Spitter index (step 14).** k counts only spitters, in spawn order (room table order; the practice room uses `spawn` order). A defeated spitter does not renumber the others.
- **Cap.** At most 3 shots in flight in the room. A spitter that would start a cue while 3 shots are in flight waits 0.2 s and checks again.
- **Cap delay (step 14).** The 0.2 s wait starts at the moment the cue would have started, and repeats until a slot is free. The delay moves that shot later, and the spitter's following shots keep 2.4 s from its actual shot (the delay carries forward). The first-shot times in criterion 11 are not affected, because the cap is not reached by then.
- **HP** 2, stationary, and can be swiped at any time. No change.

## Rooms (C: light pass, existing enemies and parameter variants only)

5 rooms, 3–6 enemies each. A room ends when all enemies are defeated. Positions are (x, y) in tiles.

| Room | Contents (changes from 0.4 in bold) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Standard grubs at (3,4), (15,4), (8,0) (unchanged) | Teach the lunge cue against one grub at a time |
| 2 | **Runner (2,1), Runner (1,8), Brute (15,7), Standard (14,0)** | Different from room 1: fast fragile ones plus a slow tough one, from four corners |
| 3 | Spitters at (2,1), (14,7), (2,7) (unchanged), with the new stagger and cue | Learn the aim cue |
| 4 | **Runner (1,4)**, Standard (0,1), Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Grub lunges under fire |
| 5 | Standard (1,1), Standard (0,6), **Brute (4,8)**, Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Hardest, most threats at once |

Rooms 4–5 were read from the room data in the repo; no human has seen them yet.

## Acceptance criteria

### Verifiable (QA, with `play` and `bots`)

Scripts for 1–11 use the practice room (`room empty`, `spawn`, `player`), so they work at both `fps 30` and `fps 60`. Every check holds at BOTH rates.

Grub:

1. **Telegraph.** A standard grub within 2.0 tiles of a stationary player shows the wind-up message and the cue. The hit lands no earlier than 0.5 s after the cue first appears, ±1 frame.
2. **Sidestep works.** A player who moves 1 tile sideways (up or down relative to the grub's line) within 0.4 s after the cue appears takes no damage from that lunge.
3. **Dash works.** A dash started at any point from the cue until 0.1 s before the lunge ends takes no damage, and the dash is not "ignored".
4. **Standing still is punished.** A player who does nothing for 3 s next to a standard grub loses at least 1 heart.
5. **Safe window.** During recovery the grub does not damage the player on contact.
6. **Cancel.** Two swipes kill a standard grub. A swipe that lands during wind-up stops the lunge. A swipe that kills a grub in wind-up kills it with no stagger and no lunge.
7. **One at a time.** With 3 grubs close together, no two grubs are in wind-up or lunge at the same moment.
8. **Variants.** Runner dies to one swipe, brute to four. Marks `r` and `G` appear in the text view and are listed in the manual.

Spitter:

9. **Cue.** The cue and message appear 0.6 s ±1 frame before each shot, and the shot is fired along the locked line.
10. **Dodge works.** A player who moves aside by 1 tile within 0.4 s after the cue appears is not hit by that shot.
11. **Stagger.** In room 3 the first shots are at 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s ±1 frame. Never more than 3 shots in flight.

Rooms and bots (step 14 rulings). Each bot result is a balance proxy for a player-observable behavior, stated per criterion. The bots are `walker` (a player who walks up, swipes, never dashes and ignores wind-up and aim cues), `dodger` (a player who reads cues, swipes or dodges, and uses the dash) and `camper` (a player who stays put and swings).

12. **Rooms differ.** The contents match the table above.
13. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, spitter rooms.** Protects: reading the aim cue is clearly better than ignoring it, and ignoring it is costly but not hopeless. At each rate separately, in rooms 3–5 summed: the walker loses at least 3 and at most 6 hearts and clears at least 2 of the 3 rooms. The dodger loses at most half of the walker's total and clears 3/3. The camper clears fewer of rooms 3–5 than the walker.
14. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, grub rooms (ruled in step 14).** Protects: ignoring the lunge cue costs hearts, and reading it makes the grub rooms safe. At each rate separately, in rooms 1–2 summed: the walker loses at least 1 heart; the dodger loses at most 1 heart and clears both rooms. The walker is NOT required to clear room 1 or room 2. Reason: the bot never adapts, so it takes one lunge per grub, and room 1 has three grubs for 3 hearts. A human who is hit by the first lunge can learn the cue from it (see experience signals). Making a non-adapting player always survive room 1 would remove the cost that "ignoring the cue costs hearts" asks for. Observed in build 0.5: walker loses 3 in room 1 (not cleared) and 2 in room 2 (cleared); dodger 0 lost, both cleared. No build or bot change is required.
15. **Dash is used.** Protects: the dash is worth using. The dodger uses at least 1 dash in each of rooms 3–5, at each rate.
16. **Frame-rate independence (ruled in step 14).** Protects: the same fight plays the same at 30 and 60 FPS.
    - a. Criteria 1–12 hold at both rates (timings within ±1 frame, as written).
    - b. Criteria 13–15 are each evaluated at 30 FPS and at 60 FPS, and must hold at both.
    - c. The dodger must agree between rates: same set of cleared rooms, and hearts lost per room differing by at most 1 (observed: identical, 0 lost, 5/5).
    - d. The walker is NOT required to produce the same per-room numbers at 30 and 60 FPS. Reason: its decisions run on a 0.15 s grid (4.5 frames at 30, 9 at 60), so a one-frame difference in when it steps aside can decide whether a 1-tile sidestep clears a shot. That is a bot sensitivity and not a player-visible difference. The walker only has to satisfy 13 and 14 at each rate.
    - e. This ruling does not excuse a build defect. QA must still confirm the walker's differences come from bot timing. The check: with `log on`, run walker room 3 at both rates and compare decision times and states. A difference is a build defect if the same decision at the same game time (±1 frame) from the same positions gives a different outcome, or if any of 1–11 fails at one rate. That must be fixed before 16 can pass.

**Dependency note (step 14):** the earlier condition on bot behavior at 30 and 60 FPS is replaced by 16 c–e. The bots now decide on a 0.15 s time grid and the dodger reads cues; no further bot change is needed for 13–16 as written.

### Experience signals (playtest and Review, not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A player can say, before it hits, that a grub is about to lunge and from where.
- A player who is hit by the first lunge in room 1 can say what the warning looked like and avoids or cancels the second one.
- A player can say why they got hit by a shot ("I didn't move") rather than "it came out of nowhere".
- Rooms 1 and 2 are described as different fights.
- The dash is used on purpose at least once in a room, not only in panic.

## Edge cases

- Dash through a wind-up or lunge: see Grub rules. The grub finishes its phase in place.
- Two shots arriving together: the player takes at most 1 damage per hit-invulnerability window as now.
- Player dies mid-lunge or mid-cue: enemies stop (existing end-of-session handling).
- Last enemy killed during its wind-up: room cleared as usual.
- A spitter killed during its cue cancels the shot. Shots already in flight continue.
- A spitter at the player's exact position (distance 0): no aim line and no shot (as now, no shot when dist is 0).
- A grub at the player's exact position (distance 0): wind-up aims right (step 14).
- Shot locked on a player who then left the room line: the shot continues straight and disappears at the edge.

## Open questions

- Art cue details (flash, line, glow): `art-director` after Build.
- Whether the text view's `r` / `G` marks suit the graphical build.
- Whether a human playtest finds room 1 too harsh for a first-time player who ignores the first lunge (three grubs, 3 hearts). If so, the fix is a room change (for example a lone first grub), which needs its own spec step.

## Changed since 0.4

Grub behavior, Spitter timing and cue, rooms 2, 4, 5. Manual (`repo/manual.md`) lists the new marks and messages. Step 14: criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps ruled.

# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.5

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears, with the room drawn every half second and after every hit or warning.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face). You cannot be hurt while dashing.

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|runner\|brute\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |
| `when <condition> then <action>` | A reaction rule (below). |

## Reactions

Instead of (or as well as) timed inputs, you can play by reacting to what is on screen. Each frame
the rules are checked from the top; the first one whose condition holds acts. A rule acts at most
every 0.15 s, like a player's reaction time, so the next rule down can act meanwhile. A session
with rules runs until the room is cleared or you go down (at most 60 s), unless `end` says
otherwise.

| Condition | Holds when |
|---|---|
| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `r`, `G`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown (for example `text "rears back"`) |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see r within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `r` runner grub, `G` brute grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile, `~` an orange-red
line (see warnings below). Hearts are shown above the room.

- **Grub (`g`)**: 2 swipes. **Runner (`r`)**: fast, 1 swipe, short warning. **Brute (`G`)**: slow,
  4 swipes, long warning.
- **Spitter (`s`)**: 2 swipes, stays where it is.

## Warnings

Nothing hurts you without a warning. Every warning is shown for the whole time before the hit, and
the player view prints a picture when one starts.

- **A grub rears back** (message `a grub rears back`): the grub stops and flashes orange-red, and a
  line of `~` marks the 2.4 tiles it is about to lunge along. Under the room a line starting with
  `cue:` names the grub, says it flashes, and gives the line's direction and the seconds left. The
  line is fixed where you stood when the grub began; step 1 tile to the side, dash, or swipe it
  (within 1.5 tiles) to cancel the lunge. The warning lasts 0.5 s for a grub, 0.35 s for a runner,
  0.7 s for a brute. After a lunge the grub is harmless for a while: that is the time to swipe it.
  Only one grub rears back or lunges at a time.
- **A spitter takes aim** (message `a spitter takes aim`): 0.6 s before it spits, the spitter glows
  orange-red, growing brighter, and a line of `~` shows where the shot will go. The `cue:` line
  under the room gives its brightness and the seconds left. The shot goes along that line
  (`a spitter spits`). Moving 1 tile aside or dashing avoids it. Shots are slow-looking but travel
  3 tiles a second, and no more than 3 are in the air at once.
- Being hit shows `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` or `by a shot`. A swipe that interrupts a grub's warning
  staggers it for 0.4 s.

| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `r`, `G`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown (for example `text "rears back"`) |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see r within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `r` runner grub, `G` brute grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile, `~` an orange-red
line (see warnings below). Hearts are shown above the room.

- **Grub (`g`)**: 2 swipes. **Runner (`r`)**: fast, 1 swipe, short warning. **Brute (`G`)**: slow,
  4 swipes, long warning.
- **Spitter (`s`)**: 2 swipes, stays where it is.

## Warnings

Nothing hurts you without a warning. Every warning is shown for the whole time before the hit, and
the player view prints a picture when one starts.

- **A grub rears back** (message `a grub rears back`): the grub stops and flashes orange-red, and a
  line of `~` marks the 2.4 tiles it is about to lunge along. Under the room a line starting with
  `cue:` names the grub, says it flashes, and gives the line's direction and the seconds left. The
  line is fixed where you stood when the grub began; step 1 tile to the side, dash, or swipe it
  (within 1.5 tiles) to cancel the lunge. The warning lasts 0.5 s for a grub, 0.35 s for a runner,
  0.7 s for a brute. After a lunge the grub is harmless for a while: that is the time to swipe it.
  Only one grub rears back or lunges at a time.
- **A spitter takes aim** (message `a spitter takes aim`): 0.6 s before it spits, the spitter glows
  orange-red, growing brighter, and a line of `~` shows where the shot will go. The `cue:` line
  under the room gives its brightness and the seconds left. The shot goes along that line
  (`a spitter spits`). Moving 1 tile aside or dashing avoids it. Shots are slow-looking but travel
  3 tiles a second, and no more than 3 are in the air at once.
- Being hit shows `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` or `by a shot`. A swipe that interrupts a grub's warning
  staggers it for 0.4 s.

# D-001: Combat uses one attack button plus dash

## Decision

The player's combat kit is one attack button and a dash. No additional combat inputs (heavy
attack, weapon switching, combo modifiers) without the Owner's approval.

## Rationale

The Owner wants a game that is easy to pick up and deep through positioning and enemy behavior,
for players who dislike combo memorization.

## Alternatives considered

- Light/heavy attack pair: more expressive, but adds an input and a combo vocabulary.
- Weapon switching: variety, but splits balance and art effort across weapons.

## Revisit when

Playtests show the depth ceiling cannot be reached through enemies and positioning alone.

<!-- Self-contained: the recipient (any executor, any session) starts from this file and its Load

## Task

<What the recipient must do, in one or two sentences.>

## Context

<Why this work exists: the Goal and what happened so far, briefly.>

## Findings

<What the sender found or produced. For a Playtester recipient: nothing about implementation.>

## Decisions already made

<D-NNN links and one-line summaries, or "None".>

## Constraints

<Limits the recipient must respect.>

## Open questions

<Questions the recipient must answer or route, or "None".>

## Expected output

<What the recipient produces and where it goes next.>

## Sender assessment

<Optional. The sender's own evaluation and reasoning: self-test verdicts, root cause analysis,
confidence. Kept for the record and for Roles that may use it; removed before the Handoff reaches
a Role whose policy strips it (qa, playtester).>
