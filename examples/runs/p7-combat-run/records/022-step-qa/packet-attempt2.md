## You may write

- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/24-qa-to-<recipient>.md
- @run/<tests|play|trace|bots>[/<label>]: instead of your final files, up to 3 times: one block per run, holding its input script for a command with {script} (empty otherwise), plus any repo/ files you may write that the run should use. A new executor gets the results and must write every file to keep in its final answer

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 23: studio → qa — Close the open checks on build 0.5 against the final criteria 1–17 and give the verdict

## Task

Verify build 0.5 (`repo/`) against the current acceptance criteria in `design/combat.md` (criteria 1–17, plus V12 for the text build). Run the checks listed under Findings, which close the gaps from your previous report (handoff 20), and give a verdict. Check at both 30 and 60 FPS where stated.

## Context

G-001 (combat monotony). You verified criteria 1–16 earlier: 1–15 and 16a–d passed, and you raised spec questions (frame-rate graze, shot cap, walker margin, document conflicts). The game-designer ruled on them and updated `design/combat.md`. The build has not changed. Gaps from your last run: criteria 5, 6 and 8 were only run at 60 FPS, and the edge case "a defeated spitter does not renumber the others" was not run.

## Findings

Rulings now in `design/combat.md` (read the spec for the exact text; this is a summary):

- **Contact sampling (D-002).** Contact is a distance check once per frame after that frame's movement; shot reach 0.4 tile, lunge reach 0.6 tile, no swept test. The accepted band is a lateral miss within 0.01 tile inside the reach for shots and within 0.03 tile inside the reach for lunges. Inside the band, 30 and 60 FPS may differ in hit or miss only (never timing or cue). Outside the band both rates must agree and follow the geometry: smaller than reach minus tolerance hits, reach or more never hits. Criterion 16e now says a difference caused only by this band is not a build defect.
- **Shot cap (criterion 11, reworded).** In rooms 1–5 never more than 3 shots in flight. The cap is on cue starts, so in a practice room with four or more spitters the bound is 2 + the number of living spitters.
- **Walker margin (criterion 13).** The numbers stay: walker 4 lost / 2 cleared at 30 FPS, 6 lost / 3 cleared at 60 FPS, upper limit 6; dodger 0; camper 0. A walker result of 7 would be reported as a tuning question, not a defect.
- **Governing documents.** For text-build behavior, `design/combat.md` and `repo/manual.md` govern. The visual spec governs only the look in a graphical build, so V12 stays open until one exists.

Checks to run:

1. Criterion 5, the two-swipe kill (6) and the variant swipe counts (8) at `fps 30`, using the existing practice-room scripts.
2. The edge case "a defeated spitter does not renumber the others".
3. Criterion 17 (edge checks). Take your reproduction script from handoff 20 and choose spitter positions from the trace:
   - shot lateral miss of 0.39 tile or less: a hit at both rates;
   - shot lateral miss of 0.40 tile or more: no hit at both rates;
   - one grub case on each side of the lunge band: 0.57 or less hits at both rates, 0.60 or more misses at both;
   - measure and report the actual lunge band at 30 FPS. If it is wider than 0.03 tile, report that as an open spec question for the game-designer, not as a pass.
4. Criterion 11 in its new wording: room 3 at most 3 in flight over your usual window; the four-spitter practice room within 2 + living spitters.
5. Re-run the unit tests (`run_tests`) and confirm that nothing else regressed.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: one attack button plus dash; no new input.
- D-002: per-frame contact sampling is kept; the contact-edge graze is an accepted limitation of the text build.

## Constraints

- Must play correctly at 30 and 60 FPS.
- Verify from the spec, the criteria and the build, not from explanations of why it should work.
- Do not change the build or the spec. A failing criterion outside the accepted band goes to Build; a spec question goes to Design.

## Open questions

- Is the grub lunge band within 0.03 tile at 30 FPS (check 3)?
- Optional wording note for the Studio: `repo/manual.md` says "no more than 3 are in the air at once", which holds in rooms 1–5 but not in practice rooms with four or more spitters. Report whether you consider that misleading to a player. Do not edit the manual.

## Expected output

A pass/fail report per criterion (1–17, V12 status) with the figures measured. Verdict `pass` if all hold, with V12 noted as open until a graphical build exists. Address the result to `studio` (the next step is a playtest that must be composed without implementation history).

# Role: QA

## Responsibility

Reproduces defects and independently verifies that built changes meet their acceptance criteria
without breaking existing behavior.

## Decides

- Pass or fail against the acceptance criteria, with evidence.
- Whether a defect is reproducible, and its severity.

## Must not

- Modify the production code under verification. QA may add or run tests and test tooling.
- Redefine acceptance criteria, or pass a change with a known failing criterion.
- Decide intended behavior when the spec is silent — hand back to `game-designer`.

## Independence

Verify from the spec, the acceptance criteria and the build — not from the engineer's explanation
of why it should work. Prefer a fresh executor context without the implementation history.

## Works from

- For defects: the Owner's report and the relevant design documents.
- For verification: acceptance criteria, how to exercise the change, project constraints (e.g.,
  supported platforms and frame rates).
- Never the implementer's self-assessment or reasoning: a Handoff's `## Sender assessment` section
  is removed before QA receives it.

## Produces

- A defect report: reproduction steps, expected vs actual (with the source of "expected"),
  conditions, severity, acceptance criteria for the fix.
- A verification report: per-criterion pass/fail with evidence, regressions checked.

## Hands back / escalates when

- Verification fails → `gameplay-engineer`, with the failure report.
- The expected behavior is undefined → `game-designer`.
- The same criterion fails a second time → Studio routes to `technical-director`.

# Skill: Verify change

Typical roles: qa.

## When to use

After anything was built, before the work counts as done.

## Inputs

Acceptance criteria, how to exercise the change, project constraints (platforms, frame rates,
input devices), the defect report or spec the change answers.

## Method

1. Check each acceptance criterion independently, under every supported condition the criterion or
   the project constraints name. Record evidence per criterion.
2. Re-run the original reproduction steps for defects.
3. Check for regressions in neighbouring behavior the change could affect.
4. Verdict: `pass` only if every criterion passes. Otherwise `fail`, with the failing criterion,
   conditions and evidence. If a criterion cannot be judged because the expected behavior is
   undefined, report that as a spec gap.

## Output

Verification report: per-criterion result and evidence, conditions tested, regressions checked,
verdict.

## Do not

Modify the production code under test. Do not soften a failure into a pass with a note. Do not
rely on the implementer's explanation instead of observing behavior.

# Combat design (build 0.5, specified in G-001 step 07, rulings in steps 14 and 22)

Status: Build 0.5 implements the Grub, Spitter and room changes below. Step 14 settled criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps (marked "step 14" in the text). Step 22 settled the contact-edge graze, the shot cap, the walker margin and which document governs each text/visual contradiction (marked "step 22"). The player kit is unchanged from 0.4. No build change results from step 22.

## Intent

Every threat is visible before it can hurt, and every threat has an answer other than "stand and swing". Walking straight into a fight without reading it should cost hearts. Reading the cue and using a sidestep or the dash should cost fewer. Grub rooms should differ from each other, and the dash should be worth using.

## Player kit (unchanged)

- **Attack** (one button): a short swipe in the facing direction, reach 1.5 tiles. 1 damage. 0.35 s recovery.
- **Dash**: 4 tiles over 0.25 s. The player is invulnerable for the full dash duration. Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends.
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, 0.3 s hit-stun (no input), then invulnerability until 0.8 s after the hit.
- Player speed 4 tiles/s. 3 hearts per room. No new inputs (D-001).

## Timing rule (applies to everything below)

All durations are in seconds and run on accumulated time, not frame counts, so 30 and 60 FPS behave the same. Per-frame travel of a lunging grub (at most 8/30 = 0.27 tile) and of a shot (at most 3.0/30 = 0.1 tile) stays below the contact reach (0.6 and 0.4), so nothing tunnels through the player at 30 FPS.

### Contact sampling rule (step 22, accepted limitation, see D-002)

- Contact is a distance check made once per frame, after that frame's movement. Reach: shot 0.4 tile, grub lunge 0.6 tile. There is no swept test between frames.
- Consequence: when a path passes the player's center at a distance (the "lateral miss") very close to the reach, whether a frame lands close enough to count depends on the frame phase, so 30 and 60 FPS can differ in hit or miss for identical input. This is accepted for the text build.
- The accepted band is the lateral miss within these tolerances of the reach:
  - Shots: from reach − 0.01 to reach (0.39 to 0.40 tile). QA derived about 0.003 tile.
  - Lunges: from reach − 0.03 to reach (0.57 to 0.60 tile). QA derived about 0.015 tile at 30 FPS; not yet run.
- Outside the band the result must be the same at both rates and must follow the geometry: a lateral miss smaller than reach − tolerance always hits (if the player is not invulnerable), and a lateral miss of reach or more never hits.
- The band changes only hit or miss. It must never change timing, cue, message or phase of anything.

## Enemies

### Grub (A): three-phase attack with a telegraph

Phases:

1. **Approach.** Walks straight at the player at the grub's speed. Bites on contact only during the lunge (see below). Walking alone does not damage. Replaces the old "contact bite while walking".
2. **Wind-up** (starts when the player is within 2.0 tiles and no other grub is in wind-up or lunge).
   - The grub stops.
   - The aim direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the wind-up.
   - **Step 14:** if the grub is exactly on the player (distance 0), the locked direction is right (+x). The cue and line are shown as usual.
   - Visible cue for the whole wind-up duration: the grub is tinted saturated orange-red (how it pulses or flashes is presentation, see below) and a line or lane shows the lunge path (length equal to the lunge distance).
   - **Step 22:** the danger zone of a lunge is 1.2 tiles wide (0.6 either side of the locked line) and 2.4 tiles long. A graphical cue must show the lane at that real width, so the player can see that a 1-tile sidestep clears it. The text view draws a one-cell `~` line; that is the text build's presentation of the same lane and stays.
   - Text view: message "a grub rears back" when it starts.
   - Cue visible at least 0.5 s before the hit for the standard grub. The player has time to step out of the line, because player speed is 4 tiles/s and the line is 0.6 tiles to either side.
3. **Lunge.** Moves along the locked direction at lunge speed for the lunge time (distance 2.4 tiles). It stops early on contact with the player. If the player is inside reach 0.6 and not invulnerable, it deals 1 damage (once per lunge). Contact follows the sampling rule above.
4. **Recovery.** The grub is stationary and unthreatening for the recovery time, then returns to Approach. This is the safe window to swipe it.

Rules:

- A swipe that damages a grub in wind-up cancels the wind-up. The grub is staggered (no action) for 0.4 s, then returns to Approach.
- **Step 14:** a swipe that kills a grub does not stagger it. The grub is simply defeated (in wind-up too).
- **Step 14:** a grub that is hit but not killed during Approach, Lunge, Recovery or Stagger continues its phase unchanged. Only a hit during wind-up changes its phase, and a hit during stagger does not extend the stagger.
- At most one grub is in wind-up or lunge at a time. Others keep walking and wait. This prevents simultaneous unavoidable lunges.
- The player's dash invulnerability stops the damage. The lunge is not cancelled. The grub finishes the lunge, wherever it ends, then does its recovery.
- Hurt-invulnerability (0.8 s) also stops the damage the same way.
- A lunge is clamped at the room edge like all movement.
- If the player is dead or the room is cleared, grubs stop.
- **Step 22 (what is rule and what is presentation):** the rule is that the cue is visible during the whole wind-up, shows the lunge lane at its true size, and disappears at once when the wind-up is cancelled or the grub is killed. Whether the lane stays, fades or is removed during the lunge itself, and whether the tint flashes or holds a slight pulse (no faster than 3 Hz), is presentation owned by `art-director`. The text view removes the line when the lunge starts, and that is fine.

Consequence worth knowing when reading bot results: a wind-up always comes before the first contact. A player who ignores the cue and does not move takes one lunge per grub (1 heart each), then gets the recovery window to swipe it.

Parameters (Grub is one type, with parameter sets only; same behavior and same code path):

| Variant | Mark (text) | HP | Walk speed (tiles/s) | Wind-up (s) | Lunge speed (tiles/s) / time (s) | Recovery (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard grub | `g` | 2 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.8 |
| Runner grub | `r` | 1 | 1.6 | 0.35 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.6 |
| Brute grub | `G` | 4 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 1.2 |

Tuning range allowed to engineering and QA without a new spec (if bots or play need it): wind-up 0.35–0.7 s for any variant. Never below 0.35 s.

### Spitter (B): staggered, with an aim cue

- **Aim cue.** 0.6 s before each shot the spitter glows saturated orange-red, growing brighter. The shot direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the cue. The direction is shown as a thin orange-red line for the 0.6 s of the cue. Text view: "a spitter takes aim" at the start of the cue and "a spitter spits" at the shot. The shot is then fired along the locked line.
- **Step 22 (glow start):** the rule is that the cue is noticeable from its first frame, the line is at full brightness from the first frame, and only the glow ramps. The starting level of the ramp is presentation. The text view shows 0% in its `cue:` line and stays; a graphical build uses a floor of at least 30% (as in the visual spec). This changes no timing.
- **Shot.** Speed 3.0 tiles/s (was 1.6). It travels in a straight line, does 1 damage, and disappears at the room edge, on contact with the player, or after 5 s. Dash invulnerability and hurt-invulnerability stop the damage as now. Contact follows the sampling rule above.
- **Interval and stagger.** Fire interval 2.4 s (was 2.0 s). The first shot of the k-th spitter in room order (k = 0, 1, 2…) is at 1.8 s + 0.8 s × k. After that each spitter fires every 2.4 s after its previous shot. With three spitters, shots are 0.8 s apart.
- **Spitter index (step 14).** k counts only spitters, in spawn order (room table order; the practice room uses `spawn` order). A defeated spitter does not renumber the others.
- **Cap (step 22: a limit on cue starts).** A spitter may start a cue only if fewer than 3 shots are in flight at that moment; otherwise it waits 0.2 s and checks again. The cap is not rechecked when a shot fires. So shots from cues that started earlier may briefly take the number in flight above 3. At most, the count at a check is 2, plus the checking spitter's own shot, plus one for each other spitter already in a cue: never more than 2 + the number of living spitters. In every real room (at most 3 spitters, rooms 3–5) the count stays at 3 or fewer (QA: room 3 stays at 3 or fewer over 12 s). Only a practice room with four or more spitters can go above 3 (QA saw 5 with four spitters). This is intended. The reason: the cue is the telegraph, and refusing to fire a shot whose cue is already showing would break "the cue always ends in the shot" and make cues lie.
- **Cap delay (step 14).** The 0.2 s wait starts at the moment the cue would have started, and repeats until a slot is free. The delay moves that shot later, and the spitter's following shots keep 2.4 s from its actual shot (the delay carries forward). The first-shot times in criterion 11 are not affected, because the cap is not reached by then.
- **HP** 2, stationary, and can be swiped at any time. No change.

## Rooms (C: light pass, existing enemies and parameter variants only)

5 rooms, 3–6 enemies each. A room ends when all enemies are defeated. Positions are (x, y) in tiles.

| Room | Contents (changes from 0.4 in bold) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Standard grubs at (3,4), (15,4), (8,0) (unchanged) | Teach the lunge cue against one grub at a time |
| 2 | **Runner (2,1), Runner (1,8), Brute (15,7), Standard (14,0)** | Different from room 1: fast fragile ones plus a slow tough one, from four corners |
| 3 | Spitters at (2,1), (14,7), (2,7) (unchanged), with the new stagger and cue | Learn the aim cue |
| 4 | **Runner (1,4)**, Standard (0,1), Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Grub lunges under fire |
| 5 | Standard (1,1), Standard (0,6), **Brute (4,8)**, Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | Hardest, most threats at once |

Rooms 4–5 were read from the room data in the repo; no human has seen them yet.

## Acceptance criteria

### Verifiable (QA, with `play` and `bots`)

Scripts for 1–11 use the practice room (`room empty`, `spawn`, `player`), so they work at both `fps 30` and `fps 60`. Every check holds at BOTH rates.

Grub:

1. **Telegraph.** A standard grub within 2.0 tiles of a stationary player shows the wind-up message and the cue. The hit lands no earlier than 0.5 s after the cue first appears, ±1 frame.
2. **Sidestep works.** A player who moves 1 tile sideways (up or down relative to the grub's line) within 0.4 s after the cue appears takes no damage from that lunge.
3. **Dash works.** A dash started at any point from the cue until 0.1 s before the lunge ends takes no damage, and the dash is not "ignored".
4. **Standing still is punished.** A player who does nothing for 3 s next to a standard grub loses at least 1 heart.
5. **Safe window.** During recovery the grub does not damage the player on contact.
6. **Cancel.** Two swipes kill a standard grub. A swipe that lands during wind-up stops the lunge. A swipe that kills a grub in wind-up kills it with no stagger and no lunge.
7. **One at a time.** With 3 grubs close together, no two grubs are in wind-up or lunge at the same moment.
8. **Variants.** Runner dies to one swipe, brute to four. Marks `r` and `G` appear in the text view and are listed in the manual.

Spitter:

9. **Cue.** The cue and message appear 0.6 s ±1 frame before each shot, and the shot is fired along the locked line.
10. **Dodge works.** A player who moves aside by 1 tile within 0.4 s after the cue appears is not hit by that shot.
11. **Stagger and cap (step 22 wording).** In room 3 the first shots are at 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s ±1 frame. In rooms 1–5 never more than 3 shots in flight. In a practice room with four or more spitters, a cue may start only when fewer than 3 shots are in flight, and the number in flight never exceeds 2 + the number of living spitters.

Contact edge (new, step 22):

17. **Contact edge.** At each of 30 and 60 FPS, with the reproduction script from handoff 20 (`room empty`, spitter at a chosen position, player at (8, 3.6)) and positions chosen from the trace so that the shot's lateral miss is known:
    - a. Shot with a lateral miss of 0.39 tile or less: hit at both rates.
    - b. Shot with a lateral miss of 0.40 tile or more: no hit at both rates.
    - c. Lunge with a lateral miss of 0.57 tile or less: hit at both rates; of 0.60 tile or more: no hit at both rates. One scripted grub case at each side of the band is enough.
    - d. Between those values (the band) a difference between 30 and 60 FPS is accepted and is not a build defect. In the band, hit time and hearts lost may differ only by the hit itself. If QA finds that the lunge band is wider than 0.03 tile, it reports back to `game-designer` (it is a tuning or sampling question, not a failure).

Rooms and bots (step 14 rulings). Each bot result is a balance proxy for a player-observable behavior, stated per criterion. The bots are `walker` (a player who walks up, swipes, never dashes and ignores wind-up and aim cues), `dodger` (a player who reads cues, swipes or dodges, and uses the dash) and `camper` (a player who stays put and swings).

12. **Rooms differ.** The contents match the table above.
13. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, spitter rooms.** Protects: reading the aim cue is clearly better than ignoring it, and ignoring it is costly but not hopeless. At each rate separately, in rooms 3–5 summed: the walker loses at least 3 and at most 6 hearts and clears at least 2 of the 3 rooms. The dodger loses at most half of the walker's total and clears 3/3. The camper clears fewer of rooms 3–5 than the walker.
    - **Step 22:** the numbers stay as they are. Observed margin: walker 4 lost / 2 cleared at 30 FPS, 6 lost / 3 cleared at 60 FPS (exactly the upper limit). The bots are deterministic, so this is stable for the current build. A later change that moves the 60 FPS walker to 7 hearts is a tuning question for the designer, not a build defect, and is reported back and not "fixed" in the build.
14. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, grub rooms (ruled in step 14).** Protects: ignoring the lunge cue costs hearts, and reading it makes the grub rooms safe. At each rate separately, in rooms 1–2 summed: the walker loses at least 1 heart; the dodger loses at most 1 heart and clears both rooms. The walker is NOT required to clear room 1 or room 2. Reason: the bot never adapts, so it takes one lunge per grub, and room 1 has three grubs for 3 hearts. A human who is hit by the first lunge can learn the cue from it (see experience signals). Making a non-adapting player always survive room 1 would remove the cost that "ignoring the cue costs hearts" asks for. Observed in build 0.5: walker loses 3 in room 1 (not cleared) and 2 in room 2 (cleared); dodger 0 lost, both cleared. No build or bot change is required.
15. **Dash is used.** Protects: the dash is worth using. The dodger uses at least 1 dash in each of rooms 3–5, at each rate.
16. **Frame-rate independence (ruled in step 14, 16e amended in step 22).** Protects: the same fight plays the same at 30 and 60 FPS.
    - a. Criteria 1–12 and 17 hold at both rates (timings within ±1 frame, as written).
    - b. Criteria 13–15 are each evaluated at 30 FPS and at 60 FPS, and must hold at both.
    - c. The dodger must agree between rates: same set of cleared rooms, and hearts lost per room differing by at most 1 (observed: identical, 0 lost, 5/5).
    - d. The walker is NOT required to produce the same per-room numbers at 30 and 60 FPS. Reason: its decisions run on a 0.15 s grid (4.5 frames at 30, 9 at 60), so a one-frame difference in when it steps aside can decide whether a 1-tile sidestep clears a shot. That is a bot sensitivity and not a player-visible difference.
    - e. This ruling does not excuse a build defect. QA must still confirm the walker's differences come from bot timing. A difference is a build defect if the same decision at the same game time (±1 frame) from the same positions gives a different outcome, or if any of 1–11 or 17 fails at one rate. **Step 22:** a different hit or miss that is caused only by the contact sampling band (criterion 17d, lateral miss within the stated tolerance of the reach) is NOT a build defect. QA's step 20 result stands: the walker differences come from bot timing (an exact-tie float at the bot's 2.5 threshold in room 1, and diverging positions in room 3), and the graze is accepted. 16e therefore passes.

**Dependency note (step 14):** the earlier condition on bot behavior at 30 and 60 FPS is replaced by 16 c–e. The bots now decide on a 0.15 s time grid and the dodger reads cues; no further bot change is needed for 13–16 as written.

### Experience signals (playtest and Review, not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A player can say, before it hits, that a grub is about to lunge and from where.
- A player who is hit by the first lunge in room 1 can say what the warning looked like and avoids or cancels the second one.
- A player can say why they got hit by a shot ("I didn't move") rather than "it came out of nowhere".
- Rooms 1 and 2 are described as different fights.
- The dash is used on purpose at least once in a room, not only in panic.

## Edge cases

- Dash through a wind-up or lunge: see Grub rules. The grub finishes its phase in place.
- Two shots arriving together: the player takes at most 1 damage per hit-invulnerability window as now.
- Player dies mid-lunge or mid-cue: enemies stop (existing end-of-session handling).
- Last enemy killed during its wind-up: room cleared as usual.
- A spitter killed during its cue cancels the shot. Shots already in flight continue.
- A spitter at the player's exact position (distance 0): no aim line and no shot (as now, no shot when dist is 0).
- A grub at the player's exact position (distance 0): wind-up aims right (step 14).
- Shot locked on a player who then left the room line: the shot continues straight and disappears at the edge.
- Path passing the player at almost exactly the reach (step 22): see the contact sampling rule. 30 and 60 FPS may differ in hit or miss only inside the stated band.
- Four or more spitters in a practice room (step 22): in-flight shots may exceed 3, up to 2 + living spitters (cap is on cue starts).

## Which document governs (step 22)

| Point | Governs | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Lunge line width | `combat.md` rule: the cue shows the true 1.2-tile lane. Look of the lane: visual spec | "thin line" for the grub is withdrawn. The thin line is for the spitter only. |
| Spitter glow start | Timing and "noticeable from the first frame": `combat.md`. Start level of the ramp: visual spec (floor of at least 30%) | The text view keeps 0%. No timing changes. |
| Grub cue behavior | Visibility for the whole wind-up and removal on cancel or kill: `combat.md`. Tint, pulse (≤ 3 Hz) and lane fade during the lunge: visual spec | The text view removing the line at lunge start is acceptable. |
| Text marks `r` / `G` | Text build: `combat.md` and the manual (unchanged). Graphical build: visual spec (silhouette and size) | The open question is closed for the graphical build. |

For `art-director`: nothing in the visual spec must change. Only its sentence that "the design text says thin line" is out of date after this step, and the V1–V11 points need no rework. V12 stays open until a graphical build exists. Visual style is not ruled here.

## Open questions

- Art cue details (flash, line, glow): `art-director` after Build.
- Whether a human playtest finds room 1 too harsh for a first-time player who ignores the first lunge (three grubs, 3 hearts). If so, the fix is a room change (for example a lone first grub), which needs its own spec step.
- Graphical build (step 22): if its collision hitboxes differ from the text build's circles (shape or size), or a swept contact test is used, criterion 17 and the shot/lunge reach must be re-verified at 30 and 60 FPS, and the band tolerances rewritten.

## Changed since 0.4

Grub behavior, Spitter timing and cue, rooms 2, 4, 5. Manual (`repo/manual.md`) lists the new marks and messages. Step 14: criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps ruled. Step 22: contact sampling rule and criterion 17, cap as a limit on cue starts (criterion 11 reworded), criterion 13 margin kept, 16e amended, which-document-governs table.

# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.5

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears, with the room drawn every half second and after every hit or warning.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face). You cannot be hurt while dashing.

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|runner\|brute\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |
| `when <condition> then <action>` | A reaction rule (below). |

## Reactions

Instead of (or as well as) timed inputs, you can play by reacting to what is on screen. Each frame
the rules are checked from the top; the first one whose condition holds acts. A rule acts at most
every 0.15 s, like a player's reaction time, so the next rule down can act meanwhile. A session
with rules runs until the room is cleared or you go down (at most 60 s), unless `end` says
otherwise.

| Condition | Holds when |
|---|---|
| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `r`, `G`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown (for example `text "rears back"`) |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see r within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `r` runner grub, `G` brute grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile, `~` an orange-red
line (see warnings below). Hearts are shown above the room.

- **Grub (`g`)**: 2 swipes. **Runner (`r`)**: fast, 1 swipe, short warning. **Brute (`G`)**: slow,
  4 swipes, long warning.
- **Spitter (`s`)**: 2 swipes, stays where it is.

## Warnings

Nothing hurts you without a warning. Every warning is shown for the whole time before the hit, and
the player view prints a picture when one starts.

- **A grub rears back** (message `a grub rears back`): the grub stops and flashes orange-red, and a
  line of `~` marks the 2.4 tiles it is about to lunge along. Under the room a line starting with
  `cue:` names the grub, says it flashes, and gives the line's direction and the seconds left. The
  line is fixed where you stood when the grub began; step 1 tile to the side, dash, or swipe it
  (within 1.5 tiles) to cancel the lunge. The warning lasts 0.5 s for a grub, 0.35 s for a runner,
  0.7 s for a brute. After a lunge the grub is harmless for a while: that is the time to swipe it.
  Only one grub rears back or lunges at a time.
- **A spitter takes aim** (message `a spitter takes aim`): 0.6 s before it spits, the spitter glows
  orange-red, growing brighter, and a line of `~` shows where the shot will go. The `cue:` line
  under the room gives its brightness and the seconds left. The shot goes along that line
  (`a spitter spits`). Moving 1 tile aside or dashing avoids it. Shots are slow-looking but travel
  3 tiles a second, and no more than 3 are in the air at once.
- Being hit shows `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` or `by a shot`. A swipe that interrupts a grub's warning
  staggers it for 0.4 s.

# D-001: Combat uses one attack button plus dash

## Decision

The player's combat kit is one attack button and a dash. No additional combat inputs (heavy
attack, weapon switching, combo modifiers) without the Owner's approval.

## Rationale

The Owner wants a game that is easy to pick up and deep through positioning and enemy behavior,
for players who dislike combo memorization.

## Alternatives considered

- Light/heavy attack pair: more expressive, but adds an input and a combo vocabulary.
- Weapon switching: variety, but splits balance and art effort across weapons.

## Revisit when

Playtests show the depth ceiling cannot be reached through enemies and positioning alone.

# D-002: Per-frame contact sampling is kept; the contact-edge graze is an accepted limitation of the text build

## Decision

Contact (shot reach 0.4 tile, grub lunge reach 0.6 tile) stays a distance check once per frame after that frame's movement, with no swept test. At 30 and 60 FPS the hit or miss may differ only when the path's lateral miss lies in a narrow band just inside the reach: 0.39–0.40 tile for shots, 0.57–0.60 tile for lunges. Outside the band both rates must agree and follow the geometry. The band changes hit or miss only, never timing. The limitation is recorded in `design/combat.md` (Contact sampling rule, criterion 17, 16e).

## Rationale

- The band is tiny: about 0.003 tile for shots (QA, derived) and about 0.015 tile for lunges at 30 FPS (derived, not yet run). The player-sized sidestep margins are 0.3 tile or more, and the lane is 1.2 tiles wide. A player cannot see or aim at a difference of 0.003 tile.
- Both outcomes are "fair": the shot always visibly passes within about 0.4 tile of the player.
- A swept test would be a build change for no player-observable gain, against the project constraint of a small team that reuses existing systems.
- The damage a change could cause is larger than the effect: a new contact test would shift every hit time in the verified build 0.5.

## Alternatives considered

- Swept (continuous) contact test with a tolerance between 30 and 60 FPS: removes the band but changes a verified build, and has a cost with no visible benefit. Not chosen.
- Fixed sub-step contact at 120 Hz at both rates: same objection, and it only narrows the band.
- Widening the reach slightly so the case never sits in the band: moves the band, does not remove it, and changes tuning for every cue-based criterion.

## Revisit when

- A graphical build uses different hitboxes or a different contact test (re-verify criterion 17 at 30 and 60 FPS).
- A playtest reports "I dodged it and it still hit me" or the reverse, and the cause is the edge band.
- A lunge band wider than 0.03 tile is measured (QA's close-out run).

# 20: qa → studio — Build 0.5 (sha 29993eac7bb0) verified against 1–16 and V12; one open item for the designer: a frame-rate-dependent graze at the contact edge

## Task

Report the independent verification of build 0.5 against combat criteria 1–16 and V12, and settle 16e from the new `log on` output.

## Context

All evidence is from runs made in this step (tests, bots with and without `log`, play/trace scripts). No run rounds are left. Anything not run is marked "not run". The verdict is not `pass` yet. Criteria 1–15 and 16a–d pass. For 16e, the walker's differences are explained by bot timing. But a frame-rate-dependent graze at the contact edge exists in the build, shown by a scripted reproduction. The spec does not say whether that is acceptable, so it goes to `game-designer` through the Studio. No criterion has failed for a second time.

## Findings

### A. Per-criterion result

| # | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Telegraph | pass, 30 and 60 | Trace `c1-stand`: windup at frame 1 (0.033 s at 30, 0.017 s at 60). The lunge starts exactly 0.5 s later (0.533 / 0.517). The first hit lands at 0.667 / 0.633, so cue to hit is 0.633 s / 0.617 s, which is ≥ 0.5 s. The test suite checks the gap at both rates. |
| 2 Sidestep | pass, 30 and 60 | Trace `c2-side`: the player moves up from 0.1 s to 0.35 s (1.07 tiles at 30, 1.0 at 60). Hearts stay 3 through the first lunge. Later damage in that trace comes from a second lunge the script does not dodge. |
| 3 Dash | pass, 30 and 60 | Trace `c3-dash-late` (dash at 0.65 s, inside the window): 3 hearts at both rates, `dash` and `dash_end` logged, no `ignored`. The tests dash at offsets 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.6 s after the cue at both rates. |
| 4 Standing still | pass, 30 and 60 | `c1-stand` loses 2 hearts in 3 s at both rates. The test suite checks it at both rates. |
| 5 Safe window | pass at 60 (test). 30 FPS not run. | `test_recovery_is_safe` and `test_grub_walking_alone_does_not_hurt` run at 60 only. In `game.py`, grub damage happens only in the lunge phase, so I expect the same result at 30, but I did not observe it. Hurt-invulnerability (0.8 s) equals recovery (0.8 s), so trace `c1-stand` cannot isolate it. |
| 6 Cancel | pass | Trace `c6-kill-windup` at 30 and 60: the runner is defeated in wind-up, the room clears, with no stagger event and no lunge. Swipe during wind-up gives stagger and no lunge (tests, both rates). The two-swipe kill is a 60 FPS test only. |
| 7 One at a time | pass, 30 and 60 | Test: the maximum number of grubs in wind-up or lunge is 1 at both rates. |
| 8 Variants | pass | Swipes to defeat 2 / 1 / 4 (60 FPS test; not run at 30). Marks `r` and `G` are drawn (test) and listed in `manual.md`. |
| 9 Aim cue | pass, 30 and 60 | Room 3 test: aim to spit is 0.6 s ±1 frame. The shot follows the locked line (y stays 4.0 in the spitter test). |
| 10 Dodge | pass, 30 and 60 | Spitter sidestep test. |
| 11 Stagger | pass, 30 and 60 | Room 3 test: first shots at 1.8 / 2.6 / 3.4 s ±1 frame, and at most 3 shots in flight over 12 s. See finding C for a 4-spitter observation. |
| 12 Rooms | pass | `ROOMS` in `game.py` matches the table for all 5 rooms (I read it). The test checks rooms 2, 4 and the brute in room 5. |
| 13 | pass at each rate | See table B. |
| 14 | pass at each rate | See table B. |
| 15 Dash used | pass at each rate | Dodger dashes in rooms 3/4/5: 8/7/11 at 30 FPS, 10/8/14 at 60 FPS. |
| 16a | pass, with the gaps listed for 5, 6 and 8 | |
| 16b | pass | See table B. |
| 16c | pass | The dodger is identical at both rates: 0 hearts lost in every room and 5/5 cleared. |
| 16d | acknowledged | The walker differs between rates (per room, 30 FPS: 3✗ 2✓ 0✓ 1✓ 3✗; 60 FPS: 3✗ 2✓ 2✓ 2✓ 2✓). |
| 16e | walker differences: bot timing. Graze: open (see D and E). | |
| V12 | not assessable | There is no graphical build. The text-view reference timings hold at both rates: wind-up to lunge is exactly 0.5 s, and aim to spit is 0.6 s ±1 frame. The cue appears on frame 1 at both rates. |

### B. Criteria 13/14/15 numbers

The bots ran with `log off`, from `bots.py`, at each rate separately.

| | 30 FPS | 60 FPS |
|---|---|---|
| Walker lost, rooms 3–5 (need 3–6) | 0+1+3 = 4 | 2+2+2 = 6 (top of range) |
| Walker cleared, rooms 3–5 (need ≥ 2) | 2 | 3 |
| Dodger lost / cleared, rooms 3–5 (need ≤ half the walker's loss; 3/3) | 0 / 3 | 0 / 3 |
| Camper cleared, rooms 3–5 (must be < walker) | 0 | 0 |
| Walker lost, rooms 1–2 (need ≥ 1) | 3+2 = 5 | 3+2 = 5 |
| Dodger lost / cleared, rooms 1–2 (need ≤ 1; both cleared) | 0 / 2 | 0 / 2 |

The walker at 60 FPS sits at exactly 6, the limit of the range. A change of one heart would break 13. This is a tuning note for the designer, not a failure.

### C. Other observations

Neither of these fails a criterion as written.

1. **Shot cap exceeded with four spitters (practice room).** Trace `cap-four-spitters-60` has four spitters. Cues start for three spitters at 4.6 s, and each cap check sees only 2 shots in flight. At 5.2 s all three fire, while the shots from 2.6 s and 3.4 s are still in flight. By my count that is 5 shots in flight; the trace shows the hits at 5.3 s and 6.1 s. The spec text checks the cap only when a cue starts, so this may be intended. Criterion 11 says "never more than 3 in flight", and the 3-spitter room 3 stayed ≤ 3 in the test. No real room has 4 spitters. Question for the designer: is the cap a limit on cue starts or on shots in flight?
2. **Hit-stun can last one frame longer than 0.3 s.** Several `skipped decision` lines show "0.000 s of stun left" while the bot was still skipped. Examples: 60 FPS camper room 1 at frame 180; 30 FPS camper room 3 at frame 126. I infer that a tiny floating-point residue keeps `stun_left` above 0 for one extra frame. It is within ±1 frame. It shifts one bot decision, and it is a plain float effect, not tied to one frame rate.
3. **Criterion 6 and 8:** the two-swipe and variant-swipe tests run at 60 FPS only.
4. **Not run:** the "spitter index not renumbered after a defeat" edge case. No test or trace covers it.
5. **Edge cases that were run:** grub at distance 0 (trace `edge-dist0`) aims right (+1,0) and shows the cue and line. The cap delay carries forward (trace `cap-four-spitters-60`: shots at 5.2 s instead of 4.2 s, then +2.4 s).
6. **Manual check:** `manual.md` lists the marks `r` and `G`, the `~` line, both messages, warnings of 0.5 / 0.35 / 0.7 s and the 0.4 s stagger. It matches the spec.

### D. 16e — walker, room 3, 30 vs 60 FPS (`log on`)

**Room 1 at 0.30 s (the first walker difference): fully explained by the log.**
- The walker swings when `distance < 2.5`. At 0.30 s the player is at (8.0, 2.8) and the grub at (8.0, 0.3) at both rates, so the true distance is exactly 2.5.
- The logged exact values are 2.5000000000000004 at 30 FPS and 2.4999999999999964 at 60 FPS.
- So 30 FPS evaluates "not < 2.5" and walks (it swings first at 0.47 s). 60 FPS evaluates "< 2.5" and swings at 0.30 s.
- The cause is floating-point residue at an exact threshold tie in the bot. The game and the real geometry are the same. This confirms the hypothesis in handoff 16.

**Room 3: positions diverge long before any damage.**
- Decisions up to 1.05 s are the same action ("walk to spitter"). The decision grid is the same at both rates. The 30 FPS decisions land 0–1 frame later (for example 0.17 vs 0.15 s), so the player keeps its old heading up to 0.033 s longer.
- Already at 1.20 s the player is at (4.267, 2.933) at 30 FPS and (3.8, 3.4) at 60 FPS.
- The aim cue is locked on the player's position at its start, so the first shots differ in direction. From the logs: v = (2.28, 1.95) at 30 FPS and v = (1.8, 2.4) at 60 FPS. At 1.80 s the players are 0.47 tile apart.
- At 60 FPS the walker, at (3.8, 2.2) at 2.10 s, walks left into the shot. The hit at 2.25 s is at distance ≈ 0.37 (player (3.2, 2.2), shot (2.84, 2.12)), and ≈ 0.47 one frame earlier. That is a clear hit, not a graze.
- At 30 FPS the walker, at (2.933, 3.067) at 2.10 s, is somewhere else, so there is no contact.

**Conclusion:** I found no pair of decisions at the same game time (±1 frame) from the same positions that gave different outcomes. The walker difference comes from bot decision timing, plus the different positions that follow from it. The walker's room 3 difference is not a build defect. The logs are cut at 20000 characters (up to about 9.3 s at 30 FPS). They cover the first divergence and the whole of room 3 at 60 FPS, but not every later decision.

### E. Frame-rate-dependent graze at the contact edge (exists)

**Reproduction.** Shot reach is 0.4. Scripts, run at `fps 30` and `fps 60`, with `python3 play.py --view trace`:

```text
room empty
fps 30            # and 60
spawn spitter 1.04 3.70
1.3 move up
1.4 stop
end 5
```

| Spitter position | 30 FPS | 60 FPS |
|---|---|---|
| (1.04, 3.70) | **no hit**, 3 hearts at 5 s | **hit at 4.100 s**, 2 hearts |
| (1.00, 3.70) | hit at 4.100 s | hit at 4.117 s |
| (1.00, 3.73) | hit at 4.100 s | hit at 4.117 s |
| (1.00, 3.76) | hit at 4.100 s | hit at 4.117 s |

**What happens.** The first shot (spit at 1.8 s) is locked on the player at (8, 4.0), as of the cue start at 1.2 s. The player then stands at (8, 3.6). The shot line passes at a perpendicular distance of about 0.3996 from the player, which is 0.0004 inside the reach of 0.4. Contact is a distance check once per frame (a shot moves 0.1 tile per frame at 30 FPS and 0.05 at 60 FPS). The hit needs a sampled frame within about ±0.017 tile of the closest approach. That window is narrower than the frame step at both rates, so which rate catches it depends on the phase.

**Reading the 16e rule.** The scripted input, the player position and the shot line are identical at both rates, and the outcome differs. This is not a walker-timing effect. 16e defines a build defect as "same decision, same time, same positions, different outcome". Read literally, this matches. But the Timing rule in the spec only guarantees "no tunnelling", and the spec does not say what collision sampling is allowed to do at the reach edge. I do not decide whether it is acceptable.

**Size (derived by my arithmetic, not run).**
- The effect only exists when the lateral miss is within about 0.003 tile of the 0.4 reach. Misses of 0.4 or more never hit, and misses more than about 0.003 inside always hit at both rates.
- Grub lunges use reach 0.6 and a step up to 0.27 tile at 30 FPS. The same logic gives a wider band, about 0.015 tile at 30 FPS. I did not test grubs for this.
- Severity: low. Frequency: only when a player's lateral miss falls in that very narrow band. The effect is a hit or a miss and does not change timing.

## Decisions already made

- D-001: one attack button plus dash; no new input.
- Designer's rulings on 13–16 and the five spec defaults (handoff 14). They were applied as written.

## Constraints

- This verification used only the spec, the criteria and the build.
- The game was not edited.
- Supported frame rates are 30 and 60 FPS.

## Open questions

For `game-designer`, through the Studio:

1. Is the frame-rate-dependent graze (finding E) acceptable for the text build? If yes, 16e passes as ruled and the verdict becomes `pass`. If not, `gameplay-engineer` must change the contact test (for example a swept test between frames) and QA re-verifies. This would be the first failure of 16, so no `technical-director` re-plan is triggered.
2. Is the shot cap a limit on starting cues (as built) or a hard limit on shots in flight (finding C1)?
3. The walker at 60 FPS in rooms 3–5 totals exactly 6 hearts, the upper limit of criterion 13. Does the designer want to keep that margin?
4. Contradictions between `design/combat.md` and `design/combat-cues-visual-spec.md` (reported only, no ruling):
   - **Lunge line.** `combat.md` says a "thin" orange-red line for the lunge path. The visual spec draws a lane 1.2 tiles wide.
   - **Spitter glow.** `combat.md` and the text view show the glow starting at 0%. The visual spec requires a floor of at least 30%.
   - **Grub cue behaviour.** `combat.md` says the grub "flashes" for the whole wind-up. The visual spec says a steady tint with a slight pulse, no strobe, at 3 Hz or less. The lane in the visual spec stays at full strength until the lunge starts and fades during it. The text view removes the line when the lunge starts.
   - **Text marks.** `combat.md` leaves the `r` / `G` marks open for the graphical build. The visual spec uses silhouette and size instead, which answers the open question.

## Expected output

The Studio routes finding E and open questions 1–3 to `game-designer`. After the ruling:
- If E is accepted, QA's verdict is `pass`, and the gaps on criteria 5, 6, 8 at 30 FPS can be closed with one more test run.
- If E is not accepted, the Studio routes to `gameplay-engineer` with the reproduction above.

V12 stays open until a graphical build exists.

## Regression check

- **Existing tests:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` ran 34 tests, all OK. This includes the replaced walker test (13 and 14 at each rate), the dodger agreement test and the two new log tests.
- **Log on vs off:** the visible results are identical for the camper in all rooms at both rates, and for the walker in rooms 1, 2 and 3 (room 3 from the separate runs) at both rates. The `all30-log` and `all60-log` outputs were cut at 20000 characters (walker rooms 3–5 and the dodger are not in the visible part). The unit test `test_bot_log_adds_state_and_changes_no_result` covers every bot, rooms 1 and 3 and both rates, and passes.
- **Bots unchanged:** the `log off` numbers equal the table in handoff 16 and the walker/dodger figures in handoff 14 (walker 4 lost / 2 cleared at 30 FPS and 6 lost / 3 cleared at 60 FPS in rooms 3–5, dodger 0 lost).
- **Log format:** every decision line has frame, grid time, frame time, player position, hearts, stun, nearest enemy with the exact distance, and shots in flight. Heart-loss lines and skipped-decision lines appear as described in `README.md`.
