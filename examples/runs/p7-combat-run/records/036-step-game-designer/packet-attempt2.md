## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create or change as one complete file block:
  `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line.
  Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 37: studio → game-designer — Rule on two spec gaps QA found (shots touching an invulnerable player; simultaneous cue starts outside rooms 4–5), then hand back for Build

## Task

Rule on two undefined behaviors reported by QA (handoff 36) and update `design/combat.md` (and a Decision if the ruling is significant) so the Build step for 0.6 can implement a complete spec. Keep the step 35 spec (Options 1 and 2, D-004) unchanged unless a ruling below forces a change; say so explicitly if it does.

## Context

G-001 (combat monotony). Your step 35 spec for build 0.6 (cue gap in rooms 4–5, brute not cancelled, manual wording) is accepted as the basis for Build. In parallel QA traced spitters in build 0.5 (handoff 36): positions, times, cue timing, interval, cap delay and in-flight counts all match the 0.5 spec at 30 and 60 FPS. No defect. The playtest's "opposite corners" and "same side" are both true (both spitters stand on the east wall, x=15, one at each end). The "in sync" report is reproducible only in a practice-room replica, through cap delay on a player who survives; QA has no real-room trace past about 7 s, so a real-room case is unconfirmed.

## Findings

QA's two open items (from handoff 36, summarized; read it for the traces):

1. **A shot that touches an invulnerable player is apparently not consumed (hypothesis, not confirmed in code).** In room 4 with a still player, shots that arrive during the hurt invulnerability window land damage exactly when the window ends (4.533 / 5.333 s at 30 FPS; 4.483 / 5.283 s at 60 FPS), 0.15–0.2 s after they visibly reached the player. Close hits can chain at the end of each 0.8 s window. The spec says a shot "disappears on contact with the player" and "invulnerability stops the damage", but not whether a blocked contact consumes the shot. QA rates this medium if unintended and thinks it contributes to "hit while lined up" and fast deaths in rooms 4–5. Not tested with the dash. The same question applies, at lesser scale, to lunges.
2. **Two cues can start together after a cap delay** (practice replica, both rates, at 6.8 s). Your gap rule covers rooms 4–5 only. QA asks whether this is acceptable in room 3 and in practice rooms.

## Decisions already made

- D-001 (attack and dash only), D-002 and D-003 (contact sampling, graze, exact reach: contact sampling must not change), D-004 (cue gap rule and offset in rooms 4–5, brute flag, Option 3 deferred).

## Constraints

- No new input, no new enemy type, no healing, no scope change. Correct at 30 and 60 FPS. Do not change contact sampling (D-002/D-003); the ruling is about what happens to the shot or lunge after a blocked contact, not how contact is detected.
- Room 3 criterion 11 (first shots 1.8, 2.6, 3.4 s) should stay as is unless you decide otherwise and say so.
- If a ruling would change the Goal's scope or a vision pillar, hand back to the Studio instead of ruling.

## Open questions

1. Should a shot that touches an invulnerable player (hurt window or dash) be consumed, pass through, or stay and hit when the window ends? State the rule, the player-observable criterion (with numbers and a way for QA to test it, including the dash), and the same for lunges. Consider the effect on difficulty in rooms 4–5, and on the dash being a worthwhile answer (the playtest reported it unused).
2. Is a simultaneous cue start acceptable in room 3 and practice rooms, or should the gap rule extend? If extended, state exactly how criterion 11 (room 3) and 18 change. If not, say why.
3. Does either ruling change your bot expectations for criteria 13–15 (hearts lost, dodger dashes)? Update them in `design/combat.md` if so.
4. Anything else in the 35 spec that these rulings make inconsistent (manual wording, criteria 6, 11, 16a, 18, 19)?

## Expected output

An updated `design/combat.md` (mark it "step 38" or as your numbering rule requires) and, if significant, a Decision file (D-005). A handoff addressed to `studio` listing the final complete set of changes for Build 0.6 (the step 35 items plus these rulings), the new and changed criteria for QA, and anything `art-director` needs. A Build is the expected next step; say if you think something else is needed first. Do not run the build or bots; this is a spec step.

## Sender assessment

The Studio found no reason to open Decide: both questions are rules and parameters inside D-001 and the pillars. Build waits for this ruling so the contact code is changed once. The art-director items from step 35 (brute hit reaction, outdated sentence about spitter spacing in the visual spec) stay deferred with the other visual criteria until a graphical build exists.

# Role: Game Designer

## Responsibility

Turns the intended player experience into rules, systems and parameters, specified precisely enough
that an engineer can build it and QA can verify it without guessing.

## Decides

- Rules, systems, tuning and player-facing behavior within the approved direction.
- Answers to spec questions raised by engineering or QA.
- Player-observable acceptance criteria.

## Must not

- Change direction, priorities or the Goal's scope — that is `game-director`.
- Write production code or choose the technical approach.
- Overrule a QA verdict; change the spec instead, and the change is verified again.

## Works from

- Playtest observations, Director decisions, spec questions from engineering or QA.
- Project vision, constraints, relevant design documents and Decisions.

## Produces

- A diagnosis: causes in design terms and solution options with trade-offs.
- A design spec: rules, parameters, edge cases, acceptance criteria, open questions.
- Answers to spec questions, applied to the design documents, plus Decisions for significant ones.

## Hands back / escalates when

- The diagnosis implies a choice of direction, priority or scope → `game-director`.
- The problem or solution is mainly about what the player sees → involve `art-director`.
- Feasibility or cost is unclear → `technical-director`.
- An Owner escalation trigger fires → `game-director`, who prepares the brief.

# Skill: Write design spec

Typical roles: game-designer, art-director (for what the player sees).

## When to use

Intended behavior is not specified well enough for an engineer to build and QA to verify.

## Inputs

The approved direction (Decision), the problem it answers, current design documents, constraints.

## Method

1. State the experience intent in one or two sentences.
2. Specify behavior as rules and numbers, not adjectives. Give every parameter a value and unit.
3. Walk the edge cases: interruptions, simultaneous events, state changes mid-action, every
   supported platform condition. Each case either gets a rule or is listed as an open question.
4. Write acceptance criteria two ways: verifiable checks for QA, and experience signals for the
   playtest and Review (kept away from the Playtester's handoff).
5. Update the project's design documents; record significant choices as Decisions.

## Output

Design spec: intent, rules and parameters, edge cases, acceptance criteria (verification and
experience), open questions, changed design documents.

## Do not

Leave "feels good" as a criterion. Do not specify the code structure.

# Combat design (build 0.5, specified in G-001 step 07, rulings in steps 14, 22, 30 and 35)

Status: Build 0.5 implements the Grub, Spitter and room changes below. Step 14 settled criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps (marked "step 14" in the text). Step 22 settled the contact-edge graze, the shot cap, the walker margin and which document governs each text/visual contradiction (marked "step 22"). Step 30 clarified the wording at exactly the reach and recorded the measured lunge band (marked "step 30"; wording only, see D-003). **Step 35 specifies two changes for the next build (0.6): a cue-gap rule for the spitters in rooms 4–5, and a brute whose wind-up is not cancelled by a swipe (marked "step 35"; see D-004). Until 0.6 exists, build 0.5 behaves as described without the step 35 parts.** The player kit is unchanged from 0.4.

## Intent

Every threat is visible before it can hurt, and every threat has an answer other than "stand and swing". Walking straight into a fight without reading it should cost hearts. Reading the cue and using a sidestep or the dash should cost fewer. Grub rooms should differ from each other, and the dash should be worth using.

**Step 35 intent.** The three melee enemies should ask for three different answers: the runner "commit or step out fast", the standard grub "either", the brute "step aside, then punish". In the crossfire rooms a player who reads a cue should have time to act on it before the next cue aims at them.

## Player kit (unchanged)

- **Attack** (one button): a short swipe in the facing direction, reach 1.5 tiles. 1 damage. 0.35 s recovery.
- **Dash**: 4 tiles over 0.25 s. The player is invulnerable for the full dash duration. Cooldown 0.6 s. An attack pressed during a dash is queued and fires when the dash ends.
- **Getting hit**: 1 heart of damage, 0.3 s hit-stun (no input), then invulnerability until 0.8 s after the hit.
- Player speed 4 tiles/s. 3 hearts per room. No new inputs (D-001).

## Timing rule (applies to everything below)

All durations are in seconds and run on accumulated time, not frame counts, so 30 and 60 FPS behave the same. Per-frame travel of a lunging grub (at most 8/30 = 0.27 tile) and of a shot (at most 3.0/30 = 0.1 tile) stays below the contact reach (0.6 and 0.4), so nothing tunnels through the player at 30 FPS.

### Contact sampling rule (step 22, accepted limitation, see D-002; step 30 wording, see D-003)

- Contact is a distance check made once per frame, after that frame's movement. A distance of exactly the reach or less counts as contact (`distance <= reach`). Reach: shot 0.4 tile, grub lunge 0.6 tile. There is no swept test between frames.
- Consequence: when a path passes the player's center at a distance (the "lateral miss") very close to the reach, whether a frame lands close enough to count depends on the frame phase, so 30 and 60 FPS can differ in hit or miss for identical input. This is accepted for the text build.
- **Step 30 (the band, defined without gaps).** The band is the range of lateral miss that is more than reach − tolerance and at most the reach, the reach itself included:
  - Shots: more than 0.39 and up to and including 0.40 tile. QA derived about 0.003 tile of actual disagreement.
  - Lunges: more than 0.57 and up to and including 0.60 tile. Measured by QA (step 24, five probes, not a full scan): a hit is guaranteed up to about 0.585 at 30 FPS, so the disagreement band is about 0.015 tile at 30 FPS and about 0.004 tile at 60 FPS. The rates disagreed only at 0.590. See D-003.
- Outside the band the result must be the same at both rates and must follow the geometry: a lateral miss of reach − tolerance or less always hits (if the player is not invulnerable), and a lateral miss greater than the reach never hits.
- **Step 30 (exactly the reach).** A lateral miss of exactly the reach (0.400 shot, 0.600 lunge) is inside the band. Hit or miss are both accepted at either rate, and the result may differ between 30 and 60 FPS. It is not a guaranteed miss, and the `<=` in the build stays.
- The band changes only hit or miss. It must never change timing, cue, message or phase of anything.

## Enemies

### Grub (A): three-phase attack with a telegraph

Phases:

1. **Approach.** Walks straight at the player at the grub's speed. Bites on contact only during the lunge (see below). Walking alone does not damage. Replaces the old "contact bite while walking".
2. **Wind-up** (starts when the player is within 2.0 tiles and no other grub is in wind-up or lunge).
   - The grub stops.
   - The aim direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the wind-up.
   - **Step 14:** if the grub is exactly on the player (distance 0), the locked direction is right (+x). The cue and line are shown as usual.
   - Visible cue for the whole wind-up duration: the grub is tinted saturated orange-red (how it pulses or flashes is presentation, see below) and a line or lane shows the lunge path (length equal to the lunge distance).
   - **Step 22:** the danger zone of a lunge is 1.2 tiles wide (0.6 either side of the locked line) and 2.4 tiles long. A graphical cue must show the lane at that real width, so the player can see that a 1-tile sidestep clears it. The text view draws a one-cell `~` line; that is the text build's presentation of the same lane and stays.
   - Text view: message "a grub rears back" when it starts (all variants, unchanged in step 35).
   - Cue visible at least 0.5 s before the hit for the standard grub. The player has time to step out of the line, because player speed is 4 tiles/s and the line is 0.6 tiles to either side.
3. **Lunge.** Moves along the locked direction at lunge speed for the lunge time (distance 2.4 tiles). It stops early on contact with the player. If the player is inside reach 0.6 and not invulnerable, it deals 1 damage (once per lunge). Contact follows the sampling rule above.
4. **Recovery.** The grub is stationary and unthreatening for the recovery time, then returns to Approach. This is the safe window to swipe it.

Rules:

- **Step 35 (cancel is a per-variant flag, "swipe cancels wind-up").** Standard grub: yes. Runner: yes. Brute: **no**. For a variant with the flag set to yes: a swipe that damages a grub in wind-up cancels the wind-up. The grub is staggered (no action) for 0.4 s, then returns to Approach.
- **Step 35 (brute, flag no).** A swipe that damages but does not kill a brute in wind-up deals its 1 damage and changes nothing else: the wind-up continues on its original timer, with no stagger, the aim stays locked, and the lunge happens at the normal time. The text view shows the message "the brute shrugs off the swipe" at the moment of the swipe. Any number of swipes in the same wind-up each deal 1 damage and each show the message. A swipe that kills the brute in wind-up defeats it as for every grub (no lunge). The brute is still hit-able and takes damage in every phase, and a hit in Approach, Lunge, Recovery or Stagger changes nothing, as for every grub.
- **Step 14:** a swipe that kills a grub does not stagger it. The grub is simply defeated (in wind-up too).
- **Step 14:** a grub that is hit but not killed during Approach, Lunge, Recovery or Stagger continues its phase unchanged. Only a hit during wind-up of a variant with the flag yes changes its phase (step 35), and a hit during stagger does not extend the stagger.
- At most one grub is in wind-up or lunge at a time. Others keep walking and wait. This prevents simultaneous unavoidable lunges.
- The player's dash invulnerability stops the damage. The lunge is not cancelled. The grub finishes the lunge, wherever it ends, then does its recovery.
- Hurt-invulnerability (0.8 s) also stops the damage the same way.
- A lunge is clamped at the room edge like all movement.
- If the player is dead or the room is cleared, grubs stop.
- **Step 22 (what is rule and what is presentation):** the rule is that the cue is visible during the whole wind-up, shows the lunge lane at its true size, and disappears at once when the wind-up is cancelled or the grub is killed. Whether the lane stays, fades or is removed during the lunge itself, and whether the tint flashes or holds a slight pulse (no faster than 3 Hz), is presentation owned by `art-director`. The text view removes the line when the lunge starts, and that is fine.
- **Step 35 (brute cue stays).** Because a swipe does not cancel the brute, its cue is not removed by a swipe that does not kill it. The cue is removed only by the kill, and as before it ends at the lunge. The lane geometry is identical for all variants.

Consequence worth knowing when reading bot results: a wind-up always comes before the first contact. A player who ignores the cue and does not move takes one lunge per grub (1 heart each), then gets the recovery window to swipe it. **Step 35:** a player who stands and swipes a brute during its wind-up now also takes the lunge. The recovery window of the brute is 1.2 s, in which up to four swipes fit if the player is in reach and facing it from the start (0.35 s per swipe). With a human reaction time of about 0.3 s, about three fit, so killing a full-health brute normally takes two windows. This is a derivation, not a measurement.

Parameters (Grub is one type, with parameter sets only; same behavior and same code path):

| Variant | Mark (text) | HP | Walk speed (tiles/s) | Wind-up (s) | Lunge speed (tiles/s) / time (s) | Recovery (s) | Swipe cancels wind-up (step 35) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard grub | `g` | 2 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.8 | yes |
| Runner grub | `r` | 1 | 1.6 | 0.35 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 0.6 | yes |
| Brute grub | `G` | 4 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 8.0 / 0.3 | 1.2 | **no** |

Tuning range allowed to engineering and QA without a new spec (if bots or play need it): wind-up 0.35–0.7 s for any variant. Never below 0.35 s. The cancel flag is not part of the tuning range.

### Spitter (B): staggered, with an aim cue

- **Aim cue.** 0.6 s before each shot the spitter glows saturated orange-red, growing brighter. The shot direction is locked to the player's position at the start of the cue. The direction is shown as a thin orange-red line for the 0.6 s of the cue. Text view: "a spitter takes aim" at the start of the cue and "a spitter spits" at the shot. The shot is then fired along the locked line.
- **Step 22 (glow start):** the rule is that the cue is noticeable from its first frame, the line is at full brightness from the first frame, and only the glow ramps. The starting level of the ramp is presentation. The text view shows 0% in its `cue:` line and stays; a graphical build uses a floor of at least 30% (as in the visual spec). This changes no timing.
- **Shot.** Speed 3.0 tiles/s (was 1.6). It travels in a straight line, does 1 damage, and disappears at the room edge, on contact with the player, or after 5 s. Dash invulnerability and hurt-invulnerability stop the damage as now. Contact follows the sampling rule above.
- **Interval and stagger.** Fire interval 2.4 s (was 2.0 s). After the first shot each spitter fires every 2.4 s after its previous shot. The first shot of the k-th spitter in room order (k = 0, 1, 2…) is at 1.8 s + *offset* × k, where *offset* is a per-room parameter (step 35):
  - Default (rooms 1–3 and practice rooms): offset 0.8 s. With three spitters, shots are 0.8 s apart (room 3, unchanged).
  - **Rooms 4 and 5 (step 35): offset 1.2 s.** With the two spitters of those rooms the first shots are at 1.8 s and 3.0 s, and then every 1.2 s alternating.
- **Spitter index (step 14).** k counts only spitters, in spawn order (room table order; the practice room uses `spawn` order). A defeated spitter does not renumber the others.
- **Cue gap rule (step 35, rooms 4 and 5 only; the rule, not the offset, is what must always hold).** Intent: after a cue ends, the player has at least 0.6 s before any spitter in the room locks onto them again, whatever the spitters' own schedules say (also if two spitters would end up firing together).
  - A spitter in a gap room may start a cue only if all of these hold at the check:
    1. no other spitter in the room has a cue running;
    2. the last shot fired in the room (by any spitter) was at least 0.6 s ago (comparison with a tolerance of 1 ms, so that an exact schedule tie counts as satisfied at both frame rates);
    3. the shot cap below allows it.
  - If a condition fails, the spitter waits 0.2 s and checks again (the same mechanism as the cap delay). The delay carries forward as in "Cap delay".
  - Player-observable form: between the shot of one cue and the start of the next cue (any spitter in rooms 4–5) there are at least 0.6 s, give or take one frame. Cue windows of different spitters never overlap.
  - A cue that is cancelled because its spitter was killed does not count as a shot for condition 2. Condition 1 only looks at running cues.
  - With the offsets above the rule is met by the schedule itself (gap exactly 0.6 s), so in the normal case it adds no delay. It acts only if the cap delay or a later change moves cues closer together.
  - Room 3 and practice rooms do not use this rule. Their gap stays at the old 0.2 s between consecutive cues in the room.
- **Cap (step 22: a limit on cue starts).** A spitter may start a cue only if fewer than 3 shots are in flight at that moment; otherwise it waits 0.2 s and checks again. The cap is not rechecked when a shot fires. So shots from cues that started earlier may briefly take the number in flight above 3. At most, the count at a check is 2, plus the checking spitter's own shot, plus one for each other spitter already in a cue: never more than 2 + the number of living spitters. In every real room (at most 3 spitters, rooms 3–5) the count stays at 3 or fewer (QA: room 3 stays at 3 or fewer over 12 s). Only a practice room with four or more spitters can go above 3 (QA saw 5 with four spitters). This is intended. The reason: the cue is the telegraph, and refusing to fire a shot whose cue is already showing would break "the cue always ends in the shot" and make cues lie.
  - **Step 35:** in rooms 4–5 the shots come 1.2 s apart (before: 0.8 s and 1.6 s alternating), and a shot lives up to 5 s, so with the player far from the spitters the cap can now delay a cue. That is accepted and wanted (fewer shots in the air). The cap stays 3 in all rooms; lowering it to 2 was considered and not taken (D-004).
- **Cap delay (step 14).** The 0.2 s wait starts at the moment the cue would have started, and repeats until a slot is free. The delay moves that shot later, and the spitter's following shots keep 2.4 s from its actual shot (the delay carries forward). The first-shot times in criterion 11 are not affected, because the cap is not reached by then.
- **HP** 2, stationary, and can be swiped at any time. No change.

## Rooms (C: light pass, existing enemies and parameter variants only)

5 rooms, 3–6 enemies each. A room ends when all enemies are defeated. Positions are (x, y) in tiles. Step 35 changes no room contents.

| Room | Contents | Spitter offset / cue gap rule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Standard grubs at (3,4), (15,4), (8,0) | n/a | Teach the lunge cue against one grub at a time |
| 2 | Runner (2,1), Runner (1,8), Brute (15,7), Standard (14,0) | n/a | Different from room 1: fast fragile ones plus a slow tough one, from four corners. Step 35: the brute now needs "step aside, then punish". |
| 3 | Spitters at (2,1), (14,7), (2,7), with the stagger and cue | 0.8 s / none | Learn the aim cue |
| 4 | Runner (1,4), Standard (0,1), Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | **1.2 s / 0.6 s gap rule** | Grub lunges under fire, with time between aims |
| 5 | Standard (1,1), Standard (0,6), Brute (4,8), Spitters (15,0), (15,8) | **1.2 s / 0.6 s gap rule** | Hardest, most threats at once |

Rooms 4–5 were read from the room data in the repo; no human has seen them yet (a hand-timed playtest of the 0.5 rooms exists in handoff 27; see the step 35 handoff).

Option 3 (swapping room 2's standard grub for a spitter) is **not** part of this slice; see D-004.

## Acceptance criteria

### Verifiable (QA, with `play` and `bots`)

Scripts for 1–11 and 19 use the practice room (`room empty`, `spawn`, `player`), so they work at both `fps 30` and `fps 60`. Every check holds at BOTH rates.

Grub:

1. **Telegraph.** A standard grub within 2.0 tiles of a stationary player shows the wind-up message and the cue. The hit lands no earlier than 0.5 s after the cue first appears, ±1 frame.
2. **Sidestep works.** A player who moves 1 tile sideways (up or down relative to the grub's line) within 0.4 s after the cue appears takes no damage from that lunge.
3. **Dash works.** A dash started at any point from the cue until 0.1 s before the lunge ends takes no damage, and the dash is not "ignored". Holds for the standard grub, the runner and the brute (step 35: this is the brute's answer too).
4. **Standing still is punished.** A player who does nothing for 3 s next to a standard grub loses at least 1 heart.
5. **Safe window.** During recovery the grub does not damage the player on contact.
6. **Cancel (step 35: standard grub and runner only).** Two swipes kill a standard grub. For a standard grub and a runner: a swipe that lands during wind-up stops the lunge. A swipe that kills a grub in wind-up kills it with no stagger and no lunge, for every variant. The brute's behavior is criterion 19.
7. **One at a time.** With 3 grubs close together, no two grubs are in wind-up or lunge at the same moment.
8. **Variants.** Runner dies to one swipe, brute to four (in any phase; step 35 does not change the hit points). Marks `r` and `G` appear in the text view and are listed in the manual.

Spitter:

9. **Cue.** The cue and message appear 0.6 s ±1 frame before each shot, and the shot is fired along the locked line.
10. **Dodge works.** A player who moves aside by 1 tile within 0.4 s after the cue appears is not hit by that shot.
11. **Stagger and cap (step 22 wording; step 35 per-room).** In room 3 the first shots are at 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s ±1 frame (unchanged). In rooms 4 and 5 the first shots are at 1.8 and 3.0 s ±1 frame, as long as both spitters are alive and the cap has not delayed a cue (it cannot by then). In rooms 1–5 never more than 3 shots in flight. In a practice room with four or more spitters, a cue may start only when fewer than 3 shots are in flight, and the number in flight never exceeds 2 + the number of living spitters.

Contact edge (new in step 22, wording clarified in step 30):

17. **Contact edge.** At each of 30 and 60 FPS, with the reproduction script from handoff 20 (`room empty`, spitter at a chosen position, player at (8, 3.6)) and positions chosen from the trace so that the shot's lateral miss is known:
    - a. Shot with a lateral miss of 0.39 tile or less: hit at both rates.
    - b. Shot with a lateral miss of more than 0.40 tile: no hit at both rates. (Step 30: exactly 0.40 is not covered here, it is in the band, see d.)
    - c. Lunge with a lateral miss of 0.57 tile or less: hit at both rates; of more than 0.60 tile: no hit at both rates. One scripted grub case at each side of the band is enough.
    - d. The band is more than 0.39 up to and including 0.40 tile for shots, and more than 0.57 up to and including 0.60 tile for lunges. Inside the band a difference between 30 and 60 FPS is accepted and is not a build defect, and this includes a miss of exactly the reach (step 30). In the band, hit time and hearts lost may differ only by the hit itself. If QA finds that the lunge band is wider than 0.03 tile, it reports back to `game-designer` (it is a tuning or sampling question, not a failure).

New in step 35:

18. **Cue gap in rooms 4–5.** At each of 30 and 60 FPS, in a trace of room 4 and of room 5 of at least 15 s each (any script; the player may be hit or die, check the part of the trace that exists), for every cue start by a spitter:
    - a. No cue of another spitter is running (cue windows do not overlap).
    - b. The previous shot fired in that room was at least 0.6 s earlier, minus one frame (0.033 s at 30 FPS, 0.017 s at 60 FPS).
    - c. The same holds after one spitter has been killed (then trivially, with one spitter every 2.4 s), and with a cap delay in effect (stand far west so shots stay in the air; a delayed cue only makes the gap longer).
    - d. If the Build step can provide a test that forces both spitters' first shots to the same time, the gap rule must still give a gap of at least 0.6 s, minus one frame. If it cannot, a and b on traces are enough and QA says that d was not run.
    - e. Cue timing itself (criterion 9: cue 0.6 s ±1 frame before the shot) and the cap (criterion 11) hold in rooms 4–5.
19. **Brute wind-up is not cancelled (new, step 35).** In the practice room with a brute and the player standing about 1 tile from it, in its lane, not dashing:
    - a. A swipe landing during the brute's wind-up reduces its hit points by 1, shows the message "the brute shrugs off the swipe" at the moment of the swipe, and does not remove the cue or stagger it. The lunge happens at 0.7 s ±1 frame after the cue appeared and the player loses 1 heart.
    - b. Two swipes in the same wind-up each deal 1 damage and each show the message. The brute still lunges once.
    - c. A swipe that kills the brute during wind-up (brute at 1 hit point left) defeats it with no lunge and no message.
    - d. A dash started before the lunge ends and the brute's wind-up swipe together: the player takes no damage from that lunge (dash invulnerability, criterion 3), and the brute still takes its swipe damage.
    - e. A swipe during the brute's recovery deals 1 damage and the phase is unchanged. The brute needs 4 damage in total, in any phase.
    - f. For comparison in the same run: a standard grub and a runner still have their wind-up cancelled by a swipe (criterion 6).

Rooms and bots (step 14 rulings). Each bot result is a balance proxy for a player-observable behavior, stated per criterion. The bots are `walker` (a player who walks up, swipes, never dashes and ignores wind-up and aim cues), `dodger` (a player who reads cues, swipes or dodges, and uses the dash) and `camper` (a player who stays put and swings).

12. **Rooms differ.** The contents match the table above.
13. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, spitter rooms.** Protects: reading the aim cue is clearly better than ignoring it, and ignoring it is costly but not hopeless. At each rate separately, in rooms 3–5 summed: the walker loses at least 3 and at most 6 hearts and clears at least 2 of the 3 rooms. The dodger loses at most half of the walker's total and clears 3/3. The camper clears fewer of rooms 3–5 than the walker.
    - **Step 22:** the numbers stay as they are. Observed margin (build 0.5): walker 4 lost / 2 cleared at 30 FPS, 6 lost / 3 cleared at 60 FPS (exactly the upper limit). The bots are deterministic, so this is stable for a given build. A later change that moves the 60 FPS walker to 7 hearts is a tuning question for the designer, not a build defect, and is reported back and not "fixed" in the build.
    - **Step 35 (expected effect, not verified):** build 0.6 changes rooms 4 and 5 (even spacing and the gap) and room 5 (the brute no longer cancels). The walker ignores cues and swipes: against the brute it now takes the lunge it used to cancel, so its hearts lost in room 5 are expected to go up, and the 60 FPS walker is already at the limit of 6. So the walker's upper limit of 6 is likely to be exceeded and its clear count of rooms 3–5 may fall below 2. The fire rate of the spitters is unchanged (still one shot per 1.2 s over the room), so the effect of the gap on the walker is uncertain in both directions. All of this must be measured by running the bots on 0.6. The numbers in the criterion stay for now. If a measured value falls outside, QA reports the numbers to `game-designer` as a tuning question (as in step 22), and it is not a build defect.
14. **Cue-ignoring vs cue-reading, grub rooms (ruled in step 14).** Protects: ignoring the lunge cue costs hearts, and reading it makes the grub rooms safe. At each rate separately, in rooms 1–2 summed: the walker loses at least 1 heart; the dodger loses at most 1 heart and clears both rooms. The walker is NOT required to clear room 1 or room 2. Reason: the bot never adapts, so it takes one lunge per grub, and room 1 has three grubs for 3 hearts. A human who is hit by the first lunge can learn the cue from it (see experience signals). Making a non-adapting player always survive room 1 would remove the cost that "ignoring the cue costs hearts" asks for. Observed in build 0.5: walker loses 3 in room 1 (not cleared) and 2 in room 2 (cleared); dodger 0 lost, both cleared. No build or bot change was required for 0.5.
    - **Step 35 (expected effect, not verified):** room 2 has a brute. The walker will lose at least as many hearts as before (the lower limit of 1 is safe), but it may now fail to clear room 2. This is allowed (the walker is not required to clear). The dodger limit (at most 1 heart in rooms 1–2, both cleared) is the risk: the dodger "swipes or dodges", and if its policy swipes a brute in its wind-up to cancel the lunge, it now takes a heart per brute lunge and may exceed 1. **Rule for the bot policy:** against the brute (mark `G`), the dodger must sidestep or dash on the cue and swipe only in recovery, never rely on a wind-up swipe. Whether `bots.py` already does so I could not check without the source or a run. The Build step checks it and changes the dodger if needed (bots are test tooling, not the build under test), and QA reports the dodger's room 1–2 numbers at both rates.
15. **Dash is used.** Protects: the dash is worth using. The dodger uses at least 1 dash in each of rooms 3–5, at each rate.
    - **Step 35 risk, not verified:** with a 0.6 s gap the dodger may sidestep every line and never need the dash in room 4, so this criterion could fail without any build defect. If it does, QA reports to `game-designer`; do not widen the cap or shorten the gap to force a dash. (The brute in room 5 now makes the dash a normal answer there.)
16. **Frame-rate independence (ruled in step 14, 16e amended in step 22).** Protects: the same fight plays the same at 30 and 60 FPS.
    - a. Criteria 1–12, 17, 18 and 19 hold at both rates (timings within ±1 frame, as written).
    - b. Criteria 13–15 are each evaluated at 30 FPS and at 60 FPS, and must hold at both.
    - c. The dodger must agree between rates: same set of cleared rooms, and hearts lost per room differing by at most 1 (observed in 0.5: identical, 0 lost, 5/5).
    - d. The walker is NOT required to produce the same per-room numbers at 30 and 60 FPS. Reason: its decisions run on a 0.15 s grid (4.5 frames at 30, 9 at 60), so a one-frame difference in when it steps aside can decide whether a 1-tile sidestep clears a shot. That is a bot sensitivity and not a player-visible difference.
    - e. This ruling does not excuse a build defect. QA must still confirm the walker's differences come from bot timing. A difference is a build defect if the same decision at the same game time (±1 frame) from the same positions gives a different outcome, or if any of 1–11, 17, 18 or 19 fails at one rate. **Step 22:** a different hit or miss that is caused only by the contact sampling band (criterion 17d, lateral miss inside the band, including exactly the reach) is NOT a build defect. QA's step 20 result stands for build 0.5: the walker differences come from bot timing (an exact-tie float at the bot's 2.5 threshold in room 1, and diverging positions in room 3), and the graze is accepted.

**Dependency note (step 14):** the earlier condition on bot behavior at 30 and 60 FPS is replaced by 16 c–e. The bots decide on a 0.15 s time grid and the dodger reads cues. **Step 35:** the one bot change that may be needed is the dodger's brute policy under criterion 14. No other bot change is expected, but whether the room 4–5 numbers hold can only be known by running the bots on 0.6.

### Experience signals (playtest and Review, not for the Playtester's handoff)

- A player can say, before it hits, that a grub is about to lunge and from where.
- A player who is hit by the first lunge in room 1 can say what the warning looked like and avoids or cancels the second one.
- A player can say why they got hit by a shot ("I didn't move") rather than "it came out of nowhere".
- Rooms 1 and 2 are described as different fights.
- The dash is used on purpose at least once in a room, not only in panic.
- **Step 35:** In rooms 4–5 a player can name which line to avoid at a given moment, and describes having a moment to reposition between aims rather than being re-aimed at where they just stepped.
- **Step 35:** A player describes the brute as needing something different from the runner and the standard grub, and can say what (for example "it doesn't flinch, I step aside and hit it afterwards") without having read the manual. A player who swipes a winding-up brute and gets hit can say why.
- **Step 35:** Dodging the brute for a long time without ever hitting it is not the usual behavior in room 2.

## Edge cases

- Dash through a wind-up or lunge: see Grub rules. The grub finishes its phase in place.
- Two shots arriving together: the player takes at most 1 damage per hit-invulnerability window as now.
- Player dies mid-lunge or mid-cue: enemies stop (existing end-of-session handling).
- Last enemy killed during its wind-up: room cleared as usual.
- A spitter killed during its cue cancels the shot. Shots already in flight continue. (Step 35: a cancelled cue does not count as a shot for the gap rule.)
- A spitter at the player's exact position (distance 0): no aim line and no shot (as now, no shot when dist is 0).
- A grub at the player's exact position (distance 0): wind-up aims right (step 14).
- Shot locked on a player who then left the room line: the shot continues straight and disappears at the edge.
- Path passing the player at almost exactly the reach, or at exactly the reach (steps 22 and 30): see the contact sampling rule. 30 and 60 FPS may differ in hit or miss only inside the stated band.
- Four or more spitters in a practice room (step 22): in-flight shots may exceed 3, up to 2 + living spitters (cap is on cue starts).
- **Step 35, brute swiped in wind-up and the player then moves out of the lane:** the lunge still goes along the locked line and misses. The swipe damage stays.
- **Step 35, brute at 1 hit point swiped in wind-up:** dies, no lunge (criterion 19c).
- **Step 35, a swipe hits a brute and a standard grub at once:** each is handled by its own rule (the standard grub, if in wind-up, is cancelled; the brute is not). Since only one grub may be in wind-up or lunge at a time, both being in wind-up does not occur.
- **Step 35, both spitters in rooms 4–5 would fire at the same time:** the gap rule makes the second wait; the pattern settles back to alternating (gap exactly 0.6 s).
- **Step 35, a cue start blocked by the gap rule at the end of a room:** if the other spitter dies, the blocked cue is simply not started (the spitter is dead); the remaining spitter is checked as usual.

## Which document governs (step 22)

| Point | Governs | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Lunge line width | `combat.md` rule: the cue shows the true 1.2-tile lane. Look of the lane: visual spec | "thin line" for the grub is withdrawn. The thin line is for the spitter only. |
| Spitter glow start | Timing and "noticeable from the first frame": `combat.md`. Start level of the ramp: visual spec (floor of at least 30%) | The text view keeps 0%. No timing changes. |
| Grub cue behavior | Visibility for the whole wind-up and removal on cancel or kill: `combat.md`. Tint, pulse (≤ 3 Hz) and lane fade during the lunge: visual spec | The text view removing the line at lunge start is acceptable. |
| Text marks `r` / `G` | Text build: `combat.md` and the manual (unchanged). Graphical build: visual spec (silhouette and size) | The open question is closed for the graphical build. |
| Step 35: brute swipe | Rule (no cancel, damage applies, message) and gap rule: `combat.md`. Look of the "no flinch" reaction: visual spec, `art-director` | The text message is a rule; the graphical hit reaction is presentation. |

For `art-director`: nothing in the visual spec must change for the lane geometry (identical for all variants). Only its sentence that the "design text says thin line" is out of date (step 22), and V1–V11 need no rework. V12 stays open until a graphical build exists. **Step 35 items for `art-director` (presentation, not ruled here):** (1) a hit reaction for a brute swiped in wind-up that reads as "took the hit, not interrupted" and is clearly different from the stagger reaction of a cancelled grub (V10 and V8 stay valid: a cancelled cue disappears at once, a brute's cue does not); (2) the visual spec's remark that spitter cues are "normally 0.8 s apart" is true only in room 3; in rooms 4–5 cues are at least 0.6 s apart and never overlap. Visual style is not ruled here.

## Open questions

- Art cue details (flash, line, glow): `art-director` after Build.
- Whether a human playtest finds room 1 too harsh for a first-time player who ignores the first lunge (three grubs, 3 hearts). If so, the fix is a room change (for example a lone first grub), which needs its own spec step.
- Graphical build (step 22): if its collision hitboxes differ from the text build's circles (shape or size), or a swept contact test is used, criterion 17 and the shot/lunge reach must be re-verified at 30 and 60 FPS, and the band tolerances rewritten.
- Step 35: whether a human, who has not read the manual, understands that the brute is not cancelled after being hit once by its lunge. The message "the brute shrugs off the swipe" is the only in-game signal. If the playtest shows the signal is missed, the next step is a presentation fix by `art-director`, not a rule change.
- Step 35: runner and brute behavior for a human, and the real crossfire experience, remain unconfirmed by scripted evidence. A hand-timed playtest follows the Build.
- Step 35: bot numbers for criteria 13–15 on build 0.6 are unknown until the bots are run.
- Step 35: Option 3 (a spitter in room 2) is deferred, see D-004.

## Changed since 0.4

Grub behavior, Spitter timing and cue, rooms 2, 4, 5. Manual (`repo/manual.md`) lists the new marks and messages. Step 14: criteria 13–16 and the five spec gaps ruled. Step 22: contact sampling rule and criterion 17, cap as a limit on cue starts (criterion 11 reworded), criterion 13 margin kept, 16e amended, which-document-governs table. Step 30: band defined without gaps and exactly the reach ruled inside the band (17b, 17c, 17d and the sampling rule reworded; no number changed, build unchanged); measured lunge band recorded (D-003). **Step 35 (for build 0.6, see D-004):** per-room spitter offset (1.2 s in rooms 4–5) and the 0.6 s cue gap rule; the brute's swipe no longer cancels its wind-up (flag column in the parameter table, message "the brute shrugs off the swipe"); criteria 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 amended; new criteria 18 and 19; manual lines given in the step 35 handoff.

# Combat cue visual spec (build 0.5 cues, for the graphical build)

Owner: art-director. Source: G-001 step 15. Basis: the text view and `design/combat.md`. I did not see a rendered build. Timings and rules are unchanged and belong to the game-designer.

## Principles

- Threat cues are saturated orange-red and **self-lit**. They do not depend on the lantern, so a cue reads in full darkness.
- The lantern is warm, pale and low-saturation (amber to cream). Threat cues are more saturated and shifted toward red, and they are the brightest saturated thing on screen.
- **Color is never the only signal.** Every cue also differs in shape or motion, so it holds up for color-blind players and under lantern tint.
- Reuse existing assets: one orange-red palette entry, one additive glow sprite, one line/quad sprite. All variants are parameter changes (scale, rate), not new assets.

## Grub lunge cue (Standard, Runner, Brute)

1. **Lane, not a hairline.** The lunge path is drawn as a band along the locked direction, 2.4 tiles long. Its width equals the actual danger zone, 1.2 tiles (0.6 either side). It is a translucent orange-red fill with a brighter hazard edge.
   - Reason: the design text says "thin line" but the danger is 1.2 tiles wide. A hairline makes a 1-tile sidestep look sufficient when it may not be.
   - Players should be able to see that stepping 1 tile sideways takes them clear of the band.
2. **Onset.** The grub flash and the lane appear at full contrast on the first frame of wind-up, with no fade-in. This matters for the Runner, whose wind-up is 0.35 s, about 10 frames at 30 FPS.
3. **Duration visibility.** The lane fills from the grub outward, or its fill brightens, so that it is complete exactly when the lunge starts. The player can judge the time left without reading text.
4. **Grub body.** The grub holds a steady orange-red tint with a slight pulse, and rears back by squashing away from the lunge direction. Do not strobe. Keep flashing at or below 3 Hz.
5. **End of cue.** The lane stays at full strength until the lunge starts, then fades during the lunge. The flash and tint stop when recovery begins, and the grub returns to its neutral cool color. A grub that is neutral and not tinted means "safe to swipe".
6. **Stagger.** A cancelled wind-up (swipe) removes the lane immediately and shows a hit reaction, so a cancelled lunge is not mistaken for a pending one.

### Variants

Differentiate by silhouette and size first, then by cue cadence. Do not use a different hue.

| Variant | Body | Lane | Cue cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner `r` | smallest, lean | full 1.2 width | fast pulse, ends in 0.35 s |
| Standard `g` | medium | full 1.2 width | medium pulse, 0.5 s |
| Brute `G` | largest, heavy | full 1.2 width | slow pulse, 0.7 s |

The lane geometry is identical, so lane width never depends on variant. All three share the lunge distance.

## Spitter aim cue

1. **Glow.** An orange-red additive glow on the spitter ramps from a **floor of at least 30% to 100%** over the 0.6 s. The text view shows 0% at the start. Do not render 0% as invisible. The cue must be noticeable on the first frame.
2. **Aim line.** A **thin** orange-red line, visually narrower than the grub lane. It runs from the spitter along the locked direction to the room edge. It is visible from the first frame of the cue at full line brightness. Only the glow ramps.
3. **End of cue.** At the shot the line disappears (it does not linger), the glow drops to neutral, and a projectile starts. The line must not be readable as a stationary shot.
4. **Distance.** The spitter glow and the line are self-lit. They must be visible when the spitter is outside the lantern radius, including in the far corners of the 16-by-9 room.
5. **Killed during cue.** The line and the glow disappear at once (the shot is cancelled).

## Shot `*`

- A compact **round** orange-red core with a short bright trail, brighter than the line, always moving.
- It must differ from the aim line by shape (a round object vs a straight line) and by motion.
- It must be readable against the lantern light and against a lane or line behind it. Give the core a light outline or a hot white center so it does not merge with a same-colored lane.

## Telling cues apart on one screen

| Thing | Shape | Motion/time signal |
|---|---|---|
| Grub lunge | wide band, short (2.4 tiles) | fills up, then the grub moves |
| Spitter aim | thin line, long (to edge) | glow ramps, then the line vanishes |
| Shot | round core with trail | moves at 3 tiles/s |
| Lantern | soft round warm pool, low saturation | static around the player |

At most one grub cue is active at once (rule). Spitter cues are normally 0.8 s apart and last 0.6 s, so they rarely overlap. They can overlap after a cap delay, and then the two aim lines must still be readable. They are identical in style, and the glow plus the line origin tell them apart.

## Player-observable acceptance criteria

V1. In a dark room with the player far from a grub, the player can see the cue (flash plus lane) without the lantern reaching it.
V2. A first-time player can state where the lunge will go and how wide it is, and can tell a 1-tile sidestep clears it.
V3. The cue is visible from the very first frame of the wind-up, including the Runner's 0.35 s, at both 30 and 60 FPS.
V4. The player can tell, without text, how much time is left before the lunge or the shot.
V5. A Runner, Standard grub and Brute are told apart by silhouette alone, in grayscale.
V6. A grub lane and a spitter aim line are told apart in grayscale (wide band vs thin line).
V7. The aim line, the shot and the lane never merge. A shot passing over a lane is still seen.
V8. A recovering or staggered grub looks clearly neutral (no tint). A player can tell when it is safe to swipe.
V9. No cue flashes faster than 3 Hz.
V10. A cancelled or killed enemy's cue disappears at once.
V11. The orange-red threat color is never confused with the warm lantern light. A threat inside the lantern radius is still clearly redder and more saturated than the lit floor.
V12. Cue timing in the graphical build matches the text-view timings at 30 and 60 FPS, within one frame.

# Lantern Depths — how to play build 0.5

Player-facing manual. A play session is an input script; the play command runs it and shows what a
player sees and hears, with the room drawn every half second and after every hit or warning.

## Controls

- **Move** in four directions; you keep moving until you stop or turn.
- **Attack**: a short swipe in the direction you face.
- **Dash**: a quick burst in a direction (or the way you face). You cannot be hurt while dashing.

## Script

One instruction per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `room 1` … `room 5` | Which room to play (default 1). `room empty` is the practice room. |
| `fps 30` or `fps 60` | Frame rate (default 60). |
| `end 12` | Stop the session at 12 seconds (default: 3 s after the last input; at most 60). |
| `<seconds> move left\|right\|up\|down` | Start moving at that time. |
| `<seconds> stop` | Stop moving. |
| `<seconds> attack` | Swipe. |
| `<seconds> dash [left\|right\|up\|down]` | Dash. |
| `spawn grub\|runner\|brute\|spitter <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place an enemy. |
| `player <x> <y>` | Practice room setup: place yourself. |
| `when <condition> then <action>` | A reaction rule (below). |

## Reactions

Instead of (or as well as) timed inputs, you can play by reacting to what is on screen. Each frame
the rules are checked from the top; the first one whose condition holds acts. A rule acts at most
every 0.15 s, like a player's reaction time, so the next rule down can act meanwhile. A session
with rules runs until the room is cleared or you go down (at most 60 s), unless `end` says
otherwise.

| Condition | Holds when |
|---|---|
| `see <mark> within <n>` | that mark (`g`, `r`, `G`, `s`, `*`, …) is on screen within n tiles of you |
| `see <mark> coming within <n>` | the same, and it has moved closer since the last frame |
| `nothing within <n>` | no enemy or shot is on screen within n tiles |
| `text "<words>"` | a message with those words was just shown (for example `text "rears back"`) |
| `hearts <= <n>` | you have n hearts or fewer |

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| `attack` | turn to what the condition saw (if anything) and swipe |
| `face` | turn to it without moving |
| `move <dir>`, `move toward`, `move away`, `move aside`, `stop` | move (`aside` steps across its line, toward the open side of the room) |
| `dash`, `dash <dir>`, `dash toward`, `dash away`, `dash aside` | dash |

Example:

```text
room 2
when see * coming within 1.5 then move aside
when see r within 1.4 then attack
when see g within 3 then face
```

The room is 16 tiles wide (x 0–15) and 9 tall (y 0–8); you start at x 8, y 4.

## On screen

`P` you, `g` grub, `r` runner grub, `G` brute grub, `s` spitter, `*` projectile, `~` an orange-red
line (see warnings below). Hearts are shown above the room.

- **Grub (`g`)**: 2 swipes. **Runner (`r`)**: fast, 1 swipe, short warning. **Brute (`G`)**: slow,
  4 swipes, long warning.
- **Spitter (`s`)**: 2 swipes, stays where it is.

## Warnings

Nothing hurts you without a warning. Every warning is shown for the whole time before the hit, and
the player view prints a picture when one starts.

- **A grub rears back** (message `a grub rears back`): the grub stops and flashes orange-red, and a
  line of `~` marks the 2.4 tiles it is about to lunge along. Under the room a line starting with
  `cue:` names the grub, says it flashes, and gives the line's direction and the seconds left. The
  line is fixed where you stood when the grub began; step 1 tile to the side, dash, or swipe it
  (within 1.5 tiles) to cancel the lunge. The warning lasts 0.5 s for a grub, 0.35 s for a runner,
  0.7 s for a brute. After a lunge the grub is harmless for a while: that is the time to swipe it.
  Only one grub rears back or lunges at a time.
- **A spitter takes aim** (message `a spitter takes aim`): 0.6 s before it spits, the spitter glows
  orange-red, growing brighter, and a line of `~` shows where the shot will go. The `cue:` line
  under the room gives its brightness and the seconds left. The shot goes along that line
  (`a spitter spits`). Moving 1 tile aside or dashing avoids it. Shots are slow-looking but travel
  3 tiles a second, and no more than 3 are in the air at once.
- Being hit shows `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` or `by a shot`. A swipe that interrupts a grub's warning
  staggers it for 0.4 s.

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.
>>>END

<<<FILE project.md#constraints
## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

# D-001: Combat uses one attack button plus dash

## Decision

The player's combat kit is one attack button and a dash. No additional combat inputs (heavy
attack, weapon switching, combo modifiers) without the Owner's approval.

## Rationale

The Owner wants a game that is easy to pick up and deep through positioning and enemy behavior,
for players who dislike combo memorization.

## Alternatives considered

- Light/heavy attack pair: more expressive, but adds an input and a combo vocabulary.
- Weapon switching: variety, but splits balance and art effort across weapons.

## Revisit when

Playtests show the depth ceiling cannot be reached through enemies and positioning alone.

# D-002: Per-frame contact sampling is kept; the contact-edge graze is an accepted limitation of the text build

## Decision

Contact (shot reach 0.4 tile, grub lunge reach 0.6 tile) stays a distance check once per frame after that frame's movement, with no swept test. At 30 and 60 FPS the hit or miss may differ only when the path's lateral miss lies in a narrow band just inside the reach: 0.39–0.40 tile for shots, 0.57–0.60 tile for lunges. Outside the band both rates must agree and follow the geometry. The band changes hit or miss only, never timing. The limitation is recorded in `design/combat.md` (Contact sampling rule, criterion 17, 16e).

## Rationale

- The band is tiny: about 0.003 tile for shots (QA, derived) and about 0.015 tile for lunges at 30 FPS (derived, not yet run). The player-sized sidestep margins are 0.3 tile or more, and the lane is 1.2 tiles wide. A player cannot see or aim at a difference of 0.003 tile.
- Both outcomes are "fair": the shot always visibly passes within about 0.4 tile of the player.
- A swept test would be a build change for no player-observable gain, against the project constraint of a small team that reuses existing systems.
- The damage a change could cause is larger than the effect: a new contact test would shift every hit time in the verified build 0.5.

## Alternatives considered

- Swept (continuous) contact test with a tolerance between 30 and 60 FPS: removes the band but changes a verified build, and has a cost with no visible benefit. Not chosen.
- Fixed sub-step contact at 120 Hz at both rates: same objection, and it only narrows the band.
- Widening the reach slightly so the case never sits in the band: moves the band, does not remove it, and changes tuning for every cue-based criterion.

## Revisit when

- A graphical build uses different hitboxes or a different contact test (re-verify criterion 17 at 30 and 60 FPS).
- A playtest reports "I dodged it and it still hit me" or the reverse, and the cause is the edge band.
- A lunge band wider than 0.03 tile is measured (QA's close-out run).

# D-003: A miss of exactly the reach is inside the contact band; measured lunge band recorded (follow-up to D-002)

## Decision

This is a follow-up to D-002. D-002 stays in force and is not edited. It is refined as follows.

1. **Exactly the reach is inside the band.** A path whose lateral miss is exactly the reach (0.400 for shots, 0.600 for lunges) belongs to the accepted band. Hit or miss is accepted at either frame rate, and 30 and 60 FPS may differ. It is not a guaranteed miss. The `distance <= reach` check in the build stays, so no Build change is needed.
2. **The band has no gap and no overlap.** It is the lateral miss more than reach − tolerance and up to and including the reach: more than 0.39 up to 0.40 for shots, more than 0.57 up to 0.60 for lunges. At reach − tolerance or less: hit at both rates. More than the reach: miss at both rates. Criterion 17 and the contact sampling rule in `design/combat.md` are reworded to this. No number changes, so criteria already verified in handoffs 20 and 24 remain valid.
3. **Measured lunge band (QA, handoff 24, derived and probed).** A lunge hit is guaranteed up to a lateral miss of about 0.585 at 30 FPS, so the disagreement band is about 0.015 tile at 30 FPS and about 0.004 tile at 60 FPS. Probes: 0.570 hit and 0.610 miss at both rates; the rates disagreed only at 0.590 (0.580 and 0.599 agreed, because the frame phase differs between positions). **Limit:** five probes, not a full scan. There is no evidence of a band wider than 0.03 tile, which is the threshold at which QA must report back. The shot band figure (about 0.003 tile) is likewise derived.

## Rationale

- Exactly the reach cannot be made a guaranteed miss without changing `<=` to `<`. That is a Build change to a verified build, and then a re-Verify, for a case a player cannot produce or see (a difference of 0.000 tile). D-002 already rejected changing contact for no player-observable gain.
- Putting the reach inside the band matches the band definition QA read ("reach − 0.01 to reach") and makes criterion 17 unambiguous without changing what was verified.
- Recording the measured band keeps D-002's estimate ("derived, not yet run") honest. The figures are well inside the 0.03 tolerance, and the sidestep margins (0.3 tile or more, 1.2-tile lane) are far larger.

## Alternatives considered

- Guaranteed miss at exactly the reach (`<` instead of `<=`): the cleaner rule on paper, but a Build change plus re-Verify of every hit-time criterion, with no visible benefit. Not chosen.
- Leave the wording ambiguous: QA already had to make a judgment call. Not chosen.
- Run a full scan of the lunge band before recording: not needed. The decision does not depend on the exact width as long as it stays within 0.03 tile.

## Revisit when

- QA or a playtest finds a lunge band wider than 0.03 tile (report to `game-designer`).
- A graphical build uses different hitboxes or a different contact test (as in D-002); criterion 17 must then be re-verified and the band rewritten.
- A playtest reports "I dodged it and it still hit me" or the reverse, and the cause is the edge band.

# D-004: Rooms 4–5 get a rule-based 0.6 s cue gap; the brute's wind-up is not cancelled by a swipe; the room 2 spitter is deferred

## Decision

1. **Cue gap as a rule (rooms 4 and 5 only).** A spitter may start a cue only when no other spitter's cue is running and the last shot in the room was at least 0.6 s ago (plus the existing cap). The first-shot offset in these rooms is 1.2 s (shots at 1.8 s and 3.0 s, then alternating every 1.2 s), which meets the rule exactly. The interval stays 2.4 s, the cap stays 3, and room 3 is unchanged.
2. **Brute is not cancelled by a swipe in wind-up.** A per-variant flag "swipe cancels wind-up": standard yes, runner yes, brute no. A swipe still damages the brute, shows "the brute shrugs off the swipe", and the lunge goes ahead. The lane geometry is the same for all variants.
3. **Option 3 (a spitter in room 2) is deferred** out of this slice.

## Rationale

- The crossfire problem (31, S4) is that a cue locks 0.2 s after the previous one ends, at the place the player dodged to. The playtest said the spitters fired "in sync", which the room table and the spec do not support. A rule on cue windows is correct either way, and a fixed offset alone would not be: a cap delay can push two cues together and the offset would not stop it. The offset is chosen so that the rule normally never has to delay anything, which keeps the verified first-shot timing style.
- The melee enemies share one answer (31, S1). A per-variant flag reuses the existing wind-up rule, keeps lane geometry and cue visuals identical (visual spec), needs no new input (D-001) and no new enemy. The brute is the best carrier: it is slow, has the longest warning and the longest recovery, so "step aside, then punish" is readable and fair.
- Option 3 would change criterion 14 and the room 2 identity at the same moment as the brute rule. Both aim at the brute dodging for 20 s, and it is not known whether the brute rule is enough. Doing both together would also make the next playtest unable to say which change worked.

## Alternatives considered

- **Only change the offset, no rule:** simpler, but not robust against a cap delay or against the unconfirmed "in sync" claim. Not chosen.
- **Lower the shot cap to 2 in rooms 4–5:** shortens the number of lines in the air, but delays cues unpredictably and makes the cue timing differ from room 3 in a way the player cannot read. Not chosen; the longer spacing already reduces shots in the air through the existing cap.
- **Gap rule in room 3 too:** room 3 teaches the cue and is verified; criterion 11 would change for no reported problem. Not chosen.
- **A new melee enemy, or widening a lane for the brute so that a dash is needed:** needs a Decide step or breaks the "identical lane geometry" rule of the visual spec. Not chosen.
- **Brute swipe cancels only with the second swipe, or cancels with a longer stagger:** a more complex rule for the player to learn, with no extra answer. Not chosen.
- **Take Option 3 in this slice:** deferred (see Rationale).

## Revisit when

- The hand-timed playtest after Build shows the crossfire in rooms 4–5 is still unfair, or the gap makes it trivial (then the gap and offset are tuning values).
- The playtest shows a human still dodges the brute without ever fighting it in room 2 (then take Option 3 or a room change in a new spec step).
- The bots show the 13/14/15 expectations cannot be met on 0.6 and the cause is the design, not bot policy.
- A graphical build changes cue presentation in a way that makes the "no flinch" signal unreadable.

# 36: qa → studio — Spitters in rooms 3–5: build 0.5 conforms to the 0.5 spec at 30 and 60 FPS; the "sync" report is explained but not reproduced in a real room; one spec gap on shots that touch an invulnerable player

## Task

Check whether the spitters in rooms 3 and 4 (and 5) fire at the positions and times `design/combat.md` specifies, how many shots are in flight, and whether the playtest observations are defects.

## Context

G-001. Evidence: `run_trace` of rooms 3, 4 and 5 with a player who does nothing (30 and 60 FPS), plus two scripted practice-room traces. Those traces used the room-4 spitters at (15,0) and (15,8), the player at (8,4), a sidestep down 1 tile during the first cue, and in one script a return to y=4 (30 and 60 FPS each).

Per the spec header, build 0.5 behaves **without** the step 35 parts. So the expected 0.5 values are offset 0.8 s in every room, and no cue-gap rule. The trace does not print projectiles. "Shots in flight" below is derived from fire times, the 3.0 tiles/s speed and the hit times, and I label it as derived.

## Findings

### 1. Positions: match the spec's room table

- Room 3: spitters at (2,1), (14,7), (2,7). Match.
- Room 4: runner (1,4), standard (0,1), spitters (15,0) and (15,8). Match.
- Room 5: standard (1,1), standard (0,6), brute (4,8), spitters (15,0) and (15,8). Match.
- The "opposite corners" vs "same side" question has a simple answer. In rooms 4 and 5 both spitters are on the **east wall (x=15)**, one at the north end and one at the south end. A playtester would call that "opposite corners". The Studio's reading of "same side" is also correct. They do not contradict each other. The spec has no layout the build departs from.

### 2. Times: match the 0.5 spec at both rates

- **First shots.**
  - Room 3: 1.8, 2.6 and 3.4 s, at both rates.
  - Rooms 4 and 5: 1.8 and 2.6 s, at both rates.
  - The cue (`cue=True`) starts at `fire_in=0.600` and the shot is at 0.6 s later, within one frame, at both rates.
  - The rooms 4–5 times of 1.8 and 2.6 s are the 0.5 default (offset 0.8). The step 35 value (1.8 and 3.0 s) is not in the build yet.
- **Interval.** Room 4 spitter at (15,0): 1.8 then 4.2 s, an interval of 2.4 s. Other shots are later than the nominal 2.4 s only by the cap delay:
  - Room 4 spitter at (15,8): nominal 5.0 s, observed 5.2 s. Derived: the cue was due at 4.4 s with 3 shots in flight, and was released at 4.6 s once the 1.8 s shot was spent.
  - Room 3 spitter at (2,1): nominal 4.2 s, observed 4.6 s. Derived: the cue was blocked at 3.6 s with 3 in flight and released at 4.0 s.
  - This is the "delay carries forward" rule (spec "Cap delay").
- **Rate differences.** All fire and cue times match between 30 and 60 FPS to within one frame. Hit times differ by about one frame, as expected.

### 3. Cue windows and gaps (rooms 4–5, still player, both rates)

- Room 4 cues: spitter (15,0) at 1.2–1.8, spitter (15,8) at 2.0–2.6, spitter (15,0) at 3.6–4.2, spitter (15,8) at 4.6–5.2.
- Room 5 has the same pattern up to the observed times.
- No cue windows overlap.
- The gap from a shot to the next cue **start** by the other spitter is **0.2 s** at 1.8 → 2.0, and **0.4 s** at 4.2 → 4.6.
- That is the 0.5 behaviour ("old 0.2 s between consecutive cues"). It is below the step 35 rule of 0.6 s, as expected for 0.5.
- It explains why a player who sidesteps the first line can have the second spitter lock onto them 0.2 s later, which matches "hit while lined up for another warning".

### 4. Simultaneous fire: reproducible in the practice room, not observed in a real room

- In the practice-room replica of room 4 (script `d4-*-back`, both rates), **both spitters start a cue at 6.8 s** (`aim; aim`, both `fire_in=0.600`) and would both fire at 7.4 s. Both rates agree.
- Derived cause:
  - The (15,0) spitter's cue was due at 6.0 s. It was blocked by the cap, because the missed 2.6 s shot was still alive (shots live up to 5 s), plus the 4.2 s and 5.0 s shots.
  - It was released at 6.8 s, after the 4.2 s shot hit at 6.733.
  - The (15,8) spitter's cue was due at 6.8 s. Both therefore start together.
- This matches the playtester's "fired in sync", but only through the cap delay on a player who survives.
- The 0.5 spec text has nothing that stops two cues starting together (cap counts shots only; the spec allows up to 2 + the number of living spitters in flight). The 0.5 build conforms to its text. The step 35 gap rule would prevent this case.
- **Not shown in a real room:** my still player in rooms 4 and 5 dies at about 5.3 s and 6.2 s, before any cap delay. I have no real-room trace past 7 s.

### 5. Shots in flight (derived)

- Room 3: 3 in flight from 3.4 to 3.9 s, then 2, then 3 again with the 4.6 and 5.0 s shots. Never above 3 (spec limit: cap check of fewer than 3 at cue start).
- Room 4 (and 5): 3 in flight at 4.2 s (shots from 1.8, 2.6 and 4.2 s). The cap blocks the next cue until a shot is spent.
- Practice replica: 3 in flight from about 5.0 to 6.7 s (derived). It stays within 2 + the number of living spitters.
- No count exceeded the spec in any trace. I did not see a printed projectile count.

### 6. Hits: which cause

Cause names: **in flight** = a shot already fired that reaches the player; **new lock** = a cue that starts after the player has moved and aims at their current position; **misread** = the player re-entering a line.

- **Player stays still (rooms 3, 4, 5).**
  - Every shot hit is a shot aimed at the standing player at its cue start. It is already in flight by the time it arrives, about 2.1–2.55 s after firing.
  - Room 3: hits at 3.9, 4.7 and 5.5 s (down at 5.5 s, with no input at all).
  - Room 4: runner lunge at about 3.7 s, then shots at about 4.5 s and 5.3 s.
  - Room 5: shots at 4.33 s and 5.13–5.15 s, then the brute lunge at about 6.15 s (down).
  - This is "standing still is punished", as specified.
- **Player dodges one line (practice replica).**
  - Sidestep down during the first cue (1.3–1.55 s): the first shot passes at a lateral miss of about 0.87 tile (derived). No hit at either rate.
  - If the player **stays** at the new position, the next cue (2.0 s) locks there, and the 2.6 s shot hits at 4.97 s (30 FPS) and 5.0 s (60 FPS). Cause: **new lock** on the standing player.
  - Later hit at 6.93 s: a **new lock** again (cue at 3.6 s locked on y=5).
  - If the player steps back up (2.1 s), the 2.6 s shot misses. Then they stand at (8,4) and are hit at 4.33 s (30 FPS) and 4.35 s (60 FPS). That is the original **in flight** shot from 1.8 s, still flying along its line, and the player stepped back into it. Cause: **in flight, misread** by the player. It is not a build error. The shot's line is the original line.
  - The hit at about 6.75 s is a **new lock** on the standing player.
  - I saw no hit on a player who had left a line and stayed out of it.

### 7. Spec gap (not a defect): a shot that touches an invulnerable player is not consumed

- Room 4, still player. The first shot from (15,0) (fired at 1.8 s) should reach the player at about 4.35 s (derived: path 8.06 tiles minus the 0.4 reach, at 3.0 tiles/s). The player is invulnerable from the runner hit at 3.7 s until 4.53 s (30 FPS) or 4.48 s (60 FPS).
- The shot's damage lands **exactly when the hurt invulnerability ends** (4.533 at 30 FPS, 4.483 at 60 FPS). The same happens with the second shot: derived arrival 5.15 s, hit at 5.333 (30 FPS) and 5.283 (60 FPS), again the moment the hurt window ends.
- Hypothesis (not confirmed in code): a shot whose contact is blocked by invulnerability is not removed and is still within reach when the window ends.
- The spec says a shot "disappears … on contact with the player" and "invulnerability stops the damage". It does not say whether a blocked contact consumes the shot, and "two shots arriving together" only says at most 1 damage per window. **The expected behavior is not defined, so this is for `game-designer`, not a defect.**
- Player-visible effect: a hit can land 0.15–0.2 s after the shot visibly reached the player, and close hits can chain at the end of each 0.8 s window. This probably contributes to the "hit while lined up" and quick deaths in rooms 4–5.
- Severity if the designer rules it unintended: medium (hurts the experience). Frequency: any shot arriving during i-frames and still within 0.4 tile when they end. Not seen with the dash, because I did not test one.
- Observation (not a defect): in room 3 the three hits are 0.8 s apart, which equals the invulnerability window, so a still player loses all 3 hearts in 1.6 s.

### Verdict

- **Build 0.5 conforms to the 0.5 spec** for spitter positions, first-shot times, cue timing (0.6 s ±1 frame), interval and cap delay, and in-flight count, at 30 and 60 FPS.
- **Differs from the step 35 spec (0.6)** in rooms 4–5, as expected: offset 0.8 instead of 1.2, no 0.6 s gap rule. Criterion 18 does not apply to 0.5.
- No defect found. Two items go to `game-designer`: the invulnerable-contact gap (finding 7), and whether simultaneous cue starts after a cap delay in room 3 should be prevented (the step 35 gap rule only covers rooms 4–5).

## Decisions already made

- D-002: graze accepted. No reported hit was in a graze band. The shot lateral miss is not near 0.39–0.40 in any case above.

## Constraints

Report only. The build, tests and scripts in `repo/` are unchanged.

## Not covered

- The playtester's deaths at 15.75 s (room 4) and 11.1 s (room 5), the room 3 double fire at about 5.8 s, and their scripts: not reproduced. I had no script, and my still player dies at about 5.3–6.2 s. In my room 3 still trace nothing fires at 5.8 s before the death at 5.5 s.
- A 15 s or longer real-room trace with a surviving player in rooms 4–5, so no real-room cap-delay alignment and no cue overlap check beyond about 6 s.
- A spitter being killed, and the gap in rooms 4–5 with one spitter left.
- A dash through a shot, and the invulnerable-contact behavior with the dash.
- `run_play`, `run_tests` and `run_bots` were not run.
- Code-level causes (hypotheses are labelled as hypotheses).
- Exact lateral misses for each shot were derived, not read from a trace of the shot position.

## Open questions

- For `game-designer`: should a shot that touches an invulnerable player (dash or hurt) be removed, or keep going and hit once the window ends? Same question applies at a lesser scale to lunges.
- For `game-designer`: is two cues starting together after a cap delay acceptable in room 3 and practice rooms?
- For `studio`: if a real-room check is wanted before 0.6, a reaction-rule script that dodges (as in the manual's example) in rooms 4 and 5 for 15 s or more would give the trace. I did not use my last run on it.

## Expected output

Studio routes findings 7 and the room-3 simultaneous-start question to `game-designer`. Handoff 27's room 4–5 items can be treated as explained by the 0.5 spec (0.2 s lock gap, cap alignment, unconsumed shot), pending the step 35 build.
