# D-011: Text-view wind-up and hit messages name the variant (accepted); swipe timing stays a wording matter

## Decision

1. The wind-up messages are `a grub rears back`, `a runner rears back` and `a brute rears back`. The hit messages are `YOU ARE HIT by a grub`, `by a runner` and `by a brute`. The shot message stays `by a shot`. The strings and acceptance criteria V-a to V-e are in `design/combat-step68.md`.
2. This completes D-008, which left the hit message out. Playtest 63 showed the hit message was the other half of the confusion.
3. No swipe-timing rule change. The late-swipe manual wording from step 59 is specified in `design/combat-step68.md` and is ready to build.
4. The change is player-facing wording within the designer's authority. It adds no input (D-001), no timing change and no new information beyond the existing `cue:` line, so it stays inside the "readable threats" pillar.
5. Build only after Review 65. It must not be mixed silently into a playtest pass of 0.6.1 (D-009 item 5): hold it until after any further 0.6.1 playtest, or state the new build number in that brief.

## Rationale

- A text-view player sees the message line first. A brute or runner reported as "a grub" hides which answer applies, and playtest 63 rated this medium impact on clarity.
- Naming the variant gives the text view the early information the graphical build gets from silhouette and size. It changes no timing or hit points.
- The shared words `rears back` keep existing reaction rules working.
- Wording alone explains the two reported late-swipe hits (QA 56). A grace period or larger reach would let a swipe cancel a started lunge and weaken "step aside or dash".

## Alternatives considered

- Keep one message for all variants: leaves the playtest confusion, and reaction-script players must parse the `cue:` line.
- Put distance and time left in the message: duplicates the `cue:` line and may make the text view easier than the graphical build.
- Wind-up renames only: leaves a brute hit labelled "a grub".
- A swipe grace period or a larger wind-up reach: needs a rule change with no defect behind it.

## Revisit when

- The next playtest still shows wasted dashes or "I could not tell what it was" after the rename.
- A human still reports late swipes as unfair after the manual wording is in.
- A graphical build makes the text messages irrelevant.
