## You may write

- goals/G-001-combat-monotony/79-gameplay-engineer-to-<recipient>.md
- repo/<path> (full file content)
- @run/<tests|trace|bots>[/<label>]: instead of your final files, up to 3 times: one block per run, holding its input script for a command with {script} (empty otherwise), plus any repo/ files you may write that the run should use. A new executor gets the results and must write every file to keep in its final answer (EDIT blocks always apply to the project files as written, never to a proposal)

## Inputs

<<<FILE studio/execution.md#executor-instructions
## Executor instructions

You are executing exactly one Studio operation, in isolation.

- Everything you may use is in this packet: the operation header, the input files, and the paths
  you may write. You know nothing else about this project, its history, or other steps, and you
  must not assume anything beyond the packet.
- Follow the procedure for this operation in the Studio files included. For a Step, act as the
  receiving Role within its contract and listed Skills; do not perform other Roles' work.
- Write every file you create as one complete file block: `<<<FILE <path>` on its own line, the
  full file content, then `>>>END` on its own line. To change part of an existing file, you may
  instead write `<<<EDIT <path>` with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> REPLACE` pairs and
  `>>>END` (Output protocol); each SEARCH must match the file exactly once, so include enough
  lines. Use only the paths listed under "You may write"; paths are relative to the project
  directory.
- Only file blocks are kept. Anything else you write is discarded and never shown to any later
  step, so put everything the next operation needs into the files.
- If the packet is not enough to do the operation, write the artifact that hands the work back or
  reports the blocker instead of guessing.

# 77: studio → gameplay-engineer — Fix the red test `test_wind_up_and_hit_messages_name_the_variant` (test only)

## Task

Fix the test defect QA found in `repo/tests/test_game.py` so the whole suite is green at 30 and 60 FPS. Change test code only; do not change game behavior in `repo/game.py`, `repo/bots.py` or `repo/manual.md`.

## Context

Goal G-001 (combat monotony). Verify 24 (QA report 76) ran the 22a build (D-011 variant messages and manual text) and the 23 build (D-012 room 3 layout). 63 of 64 tests pass and no build-behavior defect was found. The one failure:

```
FAIL: test_wind_up_and_hit_messages_name_the_variant (test_game.VariantMessageTest)
AssertionError: 3 != 1 : (30, 'grub')   (out.count("a grub rears back"), test_game.py line 763)
```

## Findings

From QA 76 (defect 1, severity low):
- The test runs 3 s with a still player and asserts the wind-up message appears once. A still player is hit, the variant recovers, walks up and winds up again, so more than one message in 3 s is correct. QA's trace shows the runner winding up at 0.033 s and again at 1.167 s at 30 FPS. For the grub QA derived wind-ups at about 0.03, 1.5 and 2.8 s at 30 FPS (not separately traced).
- The assertion stops at the first failure, so the runner and brute cases and the 60 FPS cases of this test never ran. Expect further failures of the same kind once the grub case is fixed.
- The spec (`design/combat-step68.md`, V-a) says each wind-up prints its message once, on the first frame in range. It does not say "once in 3 s".

## Decisions already made

- D-011: variant-named wind-up and hit messages (accepted). The build behaves as specified; only the test's expectation is wrong.
- D-012: room 3 layout. Not to be touched.

## Constraints

- Test code only. If you find that the build behavior differs from V-a or V-b, stop and report it instead of changing game code.
- Acceptance criteria for the fix:
  1. The whole suite is green (`run_tests`).
  2. For every variant (grub, runner, brute) and at both 30 and 60 FPS, the test still checks that (a) a wind-up message names the matching variant, (b) one message is printed per wind-up and not per frame, and (c) the hit message names the matching variant and keeps the hearts suffix. Counting messages per wind-up (for example, comparing the count with the number of wind-ups seen in the trace, or limiting the window to the first wind-up) satisfies (b).
  3. The test does not rely on a window in which a second wind-up can occur unless it counts that wind-up.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS (project constraint).
- Run `run_bots` for rooms 1–5 after the change and state that the output is unchanged from what QA 76 reported (section 2 of that report). It should be, since no game code changes.

## Open questions

None.

## Expected output

Address the result to `studio`. Report: the test change, the full `run_tests` result, and the bot check. The next step is a QA re-verify in a fresh context, so keep implementation reasoning in `## Sender assessment`, which is removed before QA receives it.

# Role: Gameplay Engineer

## Responsibility

Implements approved designs and plans as working changes to the game, and fixes defects, with tests.

## Decides

- Implementation details inside the approved spec and plan: code structure, naming, local algorithms.
- The root cause of a defect in code.

## Must not

- Decide player-facing behavior the spec does not define, or "interpret" an ambiguous spec — hand
  back instead.
- Change the spec, the plan's architecture, or the Goal's scope.
- Approve its own work; `qa` verifies.

## Works from

- An approved spec or a defect report, each with acceptance criteria.
- A plan, when the Technical Director made one.
- Project constraints and the repository.

## Produces

- The change, with tests where the project supports them.
- A Handoff to `qa`: what changed and where, how to exercise it, which acceptance criteria it
  addresses, known risks. Root cause reasoning, own test results and confidence go under
  `## Sender assessment`, which QA never receives.
- Or a hand-back: the open question, what is blocked, what could proceed.

## Hands back / escalates when

- The spec is ambiguous, contradictory, or missing a case → `game-designer`.
- The plan does not work or the risk is larger than planned → `technical-director`.
- The change would conflict with the vision or a Decision → `game-director`.
- The work needs an irreversible operation → Studio (Owner escalation trigger).

# Skill: Implement change

Typical roles: gameplay-engineer.

## When to use

An approved spec or a defect report with acceptance criteria exists, and the game must change.

## Inputs

Spec or defect report, acceptance criteria, plan (if any), constraints, repository.

## Method

1. Before coding, list every player-observable behavior the change will produce. Check each one
   against the spec or defect report. Any behavior the spec does not define is an open question,
   not a choice to make.
2. If a question blocks the work, stop that part. Hand back with: the question, the cases at
   stake, the options you can see with their technical cost, what is blocked and what can proceed.
   Do not pick an option. Do the unblocked work now if no answer would undo it, but deliver nothing
   to QA until the blocked part is resolved. For minor gaps you may propose a default for the
   designer to accept or change; never apply it before they do.
3. For defects, find and fix the root cause in the shared code path rather than patching the
   reported path only.
4. Implement, add or update tests, run them under the project's supported conditions.
5. Describe the change for QA: what changed and where, how to exercise it, which criteria it
   addresses, known risks. Put your root cause reasoning, own test results and confidence under
   `## Sender assessment` — QA verifies independently and never receives that section.

## Output

Change plus Handoff to `qa`, or a hand-back Handoff with the open question.

## Do not

Fill spec gaps with your own judgment. Do not expand scope. Do not mark your own work verified.

# Lantern Depths build

- `game.py`: the combat simulation (fixed frames, 30 or 60 FPS), build 0.6.
- `play.py`: runs an input script (`manual.md`) and prints the player view or a trace. The player
  view shows warnings as `~` lines and `cue:` lines under the room.
- `manual.md`: the player-facing manual; it changes with the build.
- `tests/`: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `bots.py`: balance bots (`camper`, `walker`, `dodger`) that play rooms and report how they fared.
  Script lines, all optional: `bots camper,walker,dodger`, `rooms 1-5` (or `rooms 1,3`), `fps 60`,
  `limit 60` (seconds per room), `log on` (print each bot's decisions). Example: `bots walker` and
  `fps 30` on two lines. Bots decide at most once per 0.15 s of accumulated game time, so they
  behave the same at 30 and 60 FPS up to frame rounding. Only the dodger reads the new cues; against
  a brute it sidesteps or dashes on the cue and swipes only in recovery (a swipe does not cancel it).
  With `log on`, each decision line ends with ` | ` and the state it was made from (frame, grid
  time, frame time, player position, hearts, stun, nearest enemy with the exact distance compared,
  shots in flight). Skipped decisions (player stunned) and every heart lost get their own lines.
  The log only reads game state; with `log` off the output is unchanged.

# Combat design addendum, step 68 (stale sentences, manual wording, variant messages)

Status: wording and message strings only. No rule, parameter, timing or room change. Where this file differs from `design/combat.md`, `design/combat-step59.md` or `repo/manual.md`, this file governs. Decisions: D-007 (unchanged), D-011 (accepts and completes D-008).

## 1. Stale sentences, superseded (room 3 in-flight bound)

`design/combat-step-46-room3-cap.md` (amended criterion 11, D-007) governs the cap. These sentences are superseded and must be folded out the next time the files are edited:

- `combat.md`, Cap paragraph: "In every real room (at most 3 spitters, rooms 3–5) the count stays at 3 or fewer (QA: room 3 stays at 3 or fewer over 12 s). Only a practice room with four or more spitters can go above 3". Replacement: in rooms 4–5 the count stays at 3 or fewer; in room 3 up to 5 is accepted after a cap delay (2 plus the living spitters).
- `combat.md`, criterion 11: "In rooms 1–5 never more than 3 shots in flight". Replacement: criterion 11 as amended in the step 46 note (a–e).
- `repo/manual.md`, spitter paragraph: "and no more than 3 are in the air at once". Replacement (exact text): "A spitter will not start aiming while 3 shots are already in the air, but shots from aims already under way still fire, so in room 3 up to 5 can be in the air at once."

## 2. Manual wording for late swipes (step 59, point 1, unchanged rules)

Replace the sentence in the grub warning bullet "or swipe a grub or runner (within 1.5 tiles) to cancel it" with this exact text:

"or swipe a grub or runner to cancel it. A swipe cancels only during the warning, and only if the enemy is within 1.5 tiles at that moment. A grub starts rearing back about 2 tiles away, beyond your reach, so step in to within 1.5 tiles during the warning. A swipe that lands after the lunge has begun does not cancel it. One swipe is enough to cancel a grub or a runner. A brute is never cancelled."

This covers every point of the step 59 acceptance list.

## 3. Runner cancel vs kill

No separate runner cancel rule is intended. A runner has 1 hp, so a swipe in reach kills it. A late swipe on a runner in reach is therefore a kill, not a cancel, and QA cannot and need not distinguish them. Criterion 6 for the runner reads: an in-reach swipe during wind-up kills it with no lunge.

## 4. Variant messages (D-011; supersedes the message table in step 59 point 2)

| Variant | Mark | Wind-up message | Hit message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard grub | `g` | `a grub rears back` | `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` |
| Runner grub | `r` | `a runner rears back` | `YOU ARE HIT by a runner` |
| Brute grub | `G` | `a brute rears back` | `YOU ARE HIT by a brute` |
| Spitter shot | n/a | unchanged | `YOU ARE HIT by a shot` (unchanged) |

Rules:
- All three wind-up messages contain `rears back`. Rules keyed on `text "rears back"` match all variants. Rules keyed on `a grub rears back` or `by a grub` match only the standard grub after the change.
- The hit message keeps its current hearts suffix. Only the noun changes.
- Applies in the player view and any other text view that prints these strings. The `cue:` line, `~` line, all timings, the swipe, kill and shrug messages, and spitter messages are unchanged.
- Graphical presentation is not affected.
- Tests and bots that match the old strings are updated by the Build.

Acceptance (verification), at 30 and 60 FPS, practice room, one case per variant:
- V-a. Each wind-up prints its message once, at the same moment as today (±1 frame).
- V-b. A hit by each variant prints the matching hit message on the frame of contact, with unchanged hearts text.
- V-c. All other output is byte-identical to 0.6.1 in the same scripts, apart from these words.
- V-d. `text "rears back"` reacts to all three variants.
- V-e. Criteria 1–11 and 17–21 of `combat.md` hold. No bot result changes.

Experience signal (Review and playtest, not for the Playtester's handoff): a text-view player can say from the message line which kind of grub is attacking or hit them.

## Open questions

- Whether the variant name changes behaviour or only moves a wasted dash is for the next playtest.
- Build timing: only after Review 65, stating the build number if a playtest follows (D-009 item 5).

# Project: Lantern Depths (sample, playable)

## Vision

A short-session top-down action roguelite: descend through lantern-lit caves, one room at a time.
Pillars:

1. **One-button combat.** Depth comes from positioning, timing and enemy behavior, not from input
   complexity. Attack and dash are the whole kit (D-001).
2. **Short runs.** A full run takes 15–20 minutes.
3. **Readable threats.** Every threat is visible before it can hurt the player.

## Player profile

Action players who want short, intense runs. Comfortable with dodging and spacing; not interested in
memorizing combo lists. Mostly play with a gamepad.

## Current state

Vertical-slice prototype, build 0.4 in `repo/`: 5 rooms in one cave biome, 2 enemy types, player
kit of attack and dash. Build 0.4 fixed damage during a dash. A play session is an input script
(`repo/manual.md`): `run_play` shows what a player sees, `run_trace` the simulation state, and
`run_tests` runs the build's tests. `run_bots` lets the team's balance bots play rooms and reports
clear times, hearts lost and actions used (`repo/bots.py`).

## Constraints

- Desktop, keyboard and gamepad.
- Must play correctly at both 30 and 60 FPS.
- Small team: prefer changes that reuse existing systems.
- No new input buttons beyond attack, dash and pause without Owner approval (D-001).

## Art direction

Dark caves lit by the player's lantern; warm light against cold blue-black. Threats use saturated
orange/red so they read against the dark.

## Design index

- `design/combat.md` — player kit, damage and invulnerability rules, enemies.
- `repo/manual.md` — controls, the play script format and reaction rules (player-facing; ships
  with the build).

# D-011: Text-view wind-up and hit messages name the variant (accepted); swipe timing stays a wording matter

## Decision

1. The wind-up messages are `a grub rears back`, `a runner rears back` and `a brute rears back`. The hit messages are `YOU ARE HIT by a grub`, `by a runner` and `by a brute`. The shot message stays `by a shot`. The strings and acceptance criteria V-a to V-e are in `design/combat-step68.md`.
2. This completes D-008, which left the hit message out. Playtest 63 showed the hit message was the other half of the confusion.
3. No swipe-timing rule change. The late-swipe manual wording from step 59 is specified in `design/combat-step68.md` and is ready to build.
4. The change is player-facing wording within the designer's authority. It adds no input (D-001), no timing change and no new information beyond the existing `cue:` line, so it stays inside the "readable threats" pillar.
5. Build only after Review 65. It must not be mixed silently into a playtest pass of 0.6.1 (D-009 item 5): hold it until after any further 0.6.1 playtest, or state the new build number in that brief.

## Rationale

- A text-view player sees the message line first. A brute or runner reported as "a grub" hides which answer applies, and playtest 63 rated this medium impact on clarity.
- Naming the variant gives the text view the early information the graphical build gets from silhouette and size. It changes no timing or hit points.
- The shared words `rears back` keep existing reaction rules working.
- Wording alone explains the two reported late-swipe hits (QA 56). A grace period or larger reach would let a swipe cancel a started lunge and weaken "step aside or dash".

## Alternatives considered

- Keep one message for all variants: leaves the playtest confusion, and reaction-script players must parse the `cue:` line.
- Put distance and time left in the message: duplicates the `cue:` line and may make the text view easier than the graphical build.
- Wind-up renames only: leaves a brute hit labelled "a grub".
- A swipe grace period or a larger wind-up reach: needs a rule change with no defect behind it.

## Revisit when

- The next playtest still shows wasted dashes or "I could not tell what it was" after the rename.
- A human still reports late swipes as unfair after the manual wording is in.
- A graphical build makes the text messages irrelevant.

# 76: qa → studio — Verification of the current build (D-011 messages and manual, D-012 room 3) at 30 and 60 FPS: FAIL on one red test; no build-behavior defect found; three checks not run

## Task

Report the verification of `repo/` (build 0.6 with D-011 and D-012) against `design/combat-step68.md` (V-a to V-e), `design/combat-step72.md` (R3-1 to R3-10) and the regression list, at 30 and 60 FPS.

## Context

Goal G-001 (combat monotony). Handoff 75 asked for a verdict per criterion for the D-011 message and manual changes and the D-012 room 3 layout change. The last verified state was 0.6.1 (QA 50 and 64). I used three run rounds: the whole test suite and the bots at both rates; player-view traces of the practice room (one per variant, both rates); and room 3 traces (still player, a no-grub replica, a last-spitter replica, a reactive dasher), both rates. No 0.6.1 output was in the packet, so nothing is compared with the earlier build byte for byte.

## Findings

### 1. `run_tests` (whole suite): FAIL, 1 of 64

```
FAIL: test_wind_up_and_hit_messages_name_the_variant (test_game.VariantMessageTest)
AssertionError: 3 != 1 : (30, 'grub')     (assertion on out.count("a grub rears back"), test_game.py line 763)
```

- 63 tests pass. This includes the room 3 contents test, the room 3 clear test (spitters and grub all needed), the manual-wording test, the `text "rears back"` test for all three variants, and the cue, cap, blocked-contact and brute tests.
- Classification: a defect in the test, not in the build. The test runs 3 s with a still player and asserts the wind-up message appears once. A still player is hit, the grub recovers, walks up and rears back again. My direct trace shows this: the runner rears back at 0.033 s and again at 1.167 s at 30 FPS. Derived for the grub at 30 FPS: wind-ups at about 0.03, 1.5 and 2.8 s, which gives the 3 the test counted. The derivation is not separately traced.
- The assertion stops at the first failure, so the runner and brute cases and the 60 FPS cases of this test never ran. I covered them by direct traces (section 3).
- Severity: low, since the build is not affected. The suite is red, so I cannot pass.

### 2. `run_bots` (rooms 1–5, limit 60 s, 3 hearts each)

| Bot / room | 30 FPS | 60 FPS |
|---|---|---|
| walker 1 | not cleared, lost 3 | not cleared, lost 3 |
| walker 2 | cleared 8.4 s, lost 2 | cleared 8.4 s, lost 2 |
| walker 3 (new layout) | cleared 8.9 s, lost 1 (grub 1), 8 attacks | cleared 9.2 s, lost 1 (grub 1), 8 attacks |
| walker 4 | cleared 9.9 s, lost 1 | not cleared, lost 3 |
| walker 5 | not cleared, lost 3 | cleared 12.9 s, lost 2 |
| dodger 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 | all cleared, 0 lost; 6.6 / 20.7 / 15.6 / 18.3 / 24.2 s; dashes 3 / 10 / 6 / 7 / 11 | all cleared, 0 lost; 9.6 / 25.1 / 15.0 / 17.0 / 28.8 s; dashes 5 / 14 / 6 / 8 / 14 |
| camper (clears) | 1/5 (room 2 only) | 0/5 |
| camper room 3 | not cleared (6.3 s), lost 3, 0 attacks | same |

Criteria against the numbers:
- **13** (rooms 3–5 summed):
  - 30 FPS: walker lost 1+1+3 = 5 (limit 3–6) and cleared 2 (limit ≥2). Dodger lost 0 (limit ≤2.5) and cleared 3/3. Camper cleared 0 of 3 rooms, fewer than the walker's 2. **Pass.**
  - 60 FPS: walker lost 1+3+2 = 6, exactly the upper limit and not above it, and cleared 2 (rooms 3 and 5). Dodger lost 0 and cleared 3/3. Camper cleared 0. **Pass, with the walker at both limits.**
  - The in-repo test comment records 7 hearts for the 60 FPS walker earlier on 0.6. It is 6 now, so the room 3 change did not push it over. The walker's loss in room 3 is 1 heart, all from the grub, at both rates.
- **14** (rooms 1–2): walker lost 5 at both rates (limit ≥1). Dodger lost 0 and cleared 2/2 (limit ≤1). **Pass.**
- **15**: dodger dashes in rooms 3 / 4 / 5 are 6 / 7 / 11 at 30 FPS and 6 / 8 / 14 at 60 FPS, all ≥1. **Pass.**
- **16c**: the dodger clears the same rooms at both rates, with hearts lost per room identical (0). **Pass.** The walker's per-room differences are allowed by 16d.
- Observation, with no limit in any design document: dodger clear times differ between rates, for example room 1 at 6.6 s vs 9.6 s and room 5 at 24.2 s vs 28.8 s. The documents define no clear-time limit, so no comparison is possible.
- Nothing is outside a limit, so no tuning question arises from the bots.

### 3. D-011 criteria (`design/combat-step68.md`)

Evidence: practice room, one enemy at (9.5, 4), player at the start, 1.2 s, both rates.

| Variant | Wind-up message, 30 / 60 FPS | Hit message and time, 30 / 60 FPS |
|---|---|---|
| grub | `a grub rears back` 0.033 / 0.017 s | `YOU ARE HIT by a grub — hearts 2/3` 0.667 / 0.633 s |
| runner | `a runner rears back` 0.033 / 0.017 s | `YOU ARE HIT by a runner — hearts 2/3` 0.533 / 0.483 s |
| brute | `a brute rears back` 0.033 / 0.017 s | `YOU ARE HIT by a brute — hearts 2/3` 0.867 / 0.833 s |

- The `cue:` line at the first picture reads 0.50 / 0.35 / 0.70 s to the lunge, and the wind-up lengths match the parameter table.
- **V-a: pass.** One message per wind-up, on the first frame in range. It is printed again only when the enemy winds up a second time. A comparison against 0.6.1 timing was not possible (no baseline).
- **V-b: pass.** The hit message names the matching variant at the contact frame. The hearts suffix is unchanged. The shot message is unchanged (`by a shot — hearts 2/3`, seen in the room 3 traces and covered by the test).
- **V-c: NOT VERIFIED.** "Byte-identical to 0.6.1" needs a 0.6.1 baseline, and the packet has none. This is a verification gap, not a failure. The `cue:` line, `~` line, swipe and shrug messages looked as specified.
- **V-d: pass.** `test_rears_back_rule_matches_all_variants` passes. In room 3 live, `when text "rears back" then dash aside` fired on `a grub rears back` (dash at 5.667 s at 30 FPS, 5.650 s at 60 FPS).
- **V-e: partial.** The 63 passing tests cover criteria 1–11 and 17–21 in the practice room at both rates. "No bot result changes" cannot be compared, because room 3 changed in the same build and there is no 0.6.1 bot output.
- **Manual text: pass.** `repo/manual.md` carries the exact replacement text for the late-swipe bullet (including "A brute is never cancelled.") and for the spitter paragraph ("so in room 3 up to 5 can be in the air at once."). It also lists all three wind-up messages and all four hit messages. The test for it passes.

### 4. D-012 criteria (`design/combat-step72.md`)

- **R3-1 contents: pass.** `game.py` ROOMS["3"] is spitters (2,1), (10,6), (2,7) and grub (15,0), and the contents test passes. The picture at 0.00 s shows the same. Rooms 1, 2, 4, 5 match the `combat.md` table (room 1 grubs (3,4), (15,4), (8,0); room 2 runners (2,1), (1,8), brute (15,7), grub (14,0); room 4 runner (1,4), grub (0,1), spitters (15,0), (15,8); room 5 grubs (1,1), (0,6), brute (4,8), spitters (15,0), (15,8)).
- **R3-2 schedule: pass.**
  - Still player: aims at 1.200, 2.000, 2.800 s and spits at 1.800, 2.600, 3.400 s at both rates (cue 0.600 s before each shot).
  - The cue and spit times of the still-player room 3 trace and the no-grub replica (three spitters, player at (8,4)) are the same up to the end of the trace. Spits fall at 1.8, 2.6, 3.4, 4.2, 5.0, 6.2 s and aims at 1.2, 2.0, 2.8, 3.6, 4.4, 5.6, 6.0 s, identical at both rates. The 6.0 s aim of the second spitter and the hits at 3.4, 5.5 and 6.3 s match too.
- **R3-3 grub after the lessons: pass.** For a still player at (8,4), the grub's first `a grub rears back` is at **6.100 s at 30 FPS and 6.083 s at 60 FPS**, against the 4.0 s minimum. The grub was at (9.7, 3.0), about 1.97 tiles from the player. No retune is needed under D-012 item 4.
- **R3-4 grub criteria in room 3: pass on the evidence I have, with a gap.**
  - Observed in room 3 live with the reactive player:
    - The cue read 0.50 s to the lunge at its first picture.
    - A swipe during the wind-up cancelled it. At 30 FPS the swipe at 7.533 s was followed by a new wind-up at 7.967 s, and no lunge came between them.
    - Two swipes killed the grub: 7.533 and 10.433 s at 30 FPS; 7.117 and 7.483 s at 60 FPS.
    - A dash on the cue (`dash aside` at 5.667 s) was followed by no grub hit.
  - The room 3 trace never showed a 1-tile sidestep, a dash late in the lunge, or a recovery swipe. Those are covered only by the practice-room tests (GrubTest) at both rates, which use the same code path. I did not run them as separate room 3 scripts.
- **R3-5 spitter criteria with the grub alive: pass.** In the still-player trace, every cue is 0.6 s before its shot. The dodge and contact-edge tests pass. In the reactive 60 FPS run the player took no damage in 20 s. The 30 FPS reactive run took one shot hit at 8.7 s. That is the scripted player's reaction timing and not a build question: its rules act every 0.15 s, and I did not trace the divergence between the rates further.
- **R3-6 D-007 bound: pass.**
  - Cue start times with and without the grub are equal up to the player's death at 6.3 s, as in R3-2. The grub's first lunge would have come at about 6.6 s.
  - In the reactive traces all three spitters start cues together after a cap delay: 6.000 s (spits at 6.600 s) at both rates, then again around 8.8–9.4 s at 30 FPS, 10.0–10.6 s at 60 FPS, and later. This is the accepted D-007 behavior and not a defect.
  - Derived in-flight counts by the step 46 method (visible `*` plus spits in the last 0.3 s):
    - 30 FPS: 4 at 7.00 s; 2 visible + 3 spits = 5 at 13.50 s.
    - 60 FPS: 5 visible at 11.00 s; 2 visible + 3 spits = 5 at 14.00 s.
    - The maximum is 5, never above 5.
  - The script is my own (it has the grub and extra rules), not the QA 43 script of criterion 11d. The method is the same.
- **R3-7 room end: pass.** The room clear test (spitters alone or grub alone does not clear; all four does) passes. In the 60 FPS reactive run the grub was killed at 7.483 s while three spitters were alive, and the session ended at 20 s with "enemies left 3" and no `room cleared`.
- **R3-8 last spitter close: PARTIAL.**
  - Geometry: pair distances are (2,1)–(10,6) = 9.43, (10,6)–(2,7) = 8.06 and (2,1)–(2,7) = 6.00 tiles, so the maximum is 9.43, within 9.5. **Pass.**
  - The "within 6 s of the previous kill" run, with a scripted kill of the grub and two spitters followed by a walk to the last spitter, was **not run**. The derived value is about 3 s (9.43 tiles at 4 tiles/s is about 2.4 s, plus two swipes). My single-spitter replica (a walk of about 7 tiles and two swipes) shows only that the walk and two swipes take about 1.35 s from the last arrival. That is not the specified measurement.
- **R3-9 messages: pass.** `a grub rears back` appears in room 3 live and `YOU ARE HIT by a grub` in the practice room. The `text "rears back"` rule reacts (see V-d).
- **R3-10 frame-rate independence: pass for what ran.** R3-2 and R3-3 differ by 0.000–0.017 s between rates (at most one 60 FPS frame, within ±1 frame). The tests cover criteria 1–12 and 17–21 at both rates.

### 5. Regression checks

- Rooms 1, 2, 4, 5: contents unchanged (R3-1). The bots clear them as in section 2, and the dodger loses 0 hearts in all of them at both rates.
- Criteria 1–11, 17–21: covered by the passing tests at 30 and 60 FPS. Criterion 11 (cap) in room 3 is covered in R3-6.
- Criteria 13–16: section 2.
- Room 3 in-flight bound: R3-6.
- Not re-run as separate traces: the criteria 17 and 20 edge cases and the room 4 and 5 gap traces. They rely on the unit tests, which pass.

### 6. Defects, conflicts, undefined behavior

1. **Defect (test, severity low, Build):** `test_wind_up_and_hit_messages_name_the_variant` expects one wind-up message in 3 s from a still player, but a variant re-winds up after recovering. The suite is red because of it. Expected source: V-a says "each wind-up prints its message once". It does not say "once in 3 s". Acceptance for the fix is a green suite that still checks, for every variant at both rates, one message per wind-up and a matching hit message.
2. **Document conflicts** (`design/combat-step72.md` governs, as the handoff says):
   - `combat.md` still has the old room 3 row (spitter at (14,7), no grub), the old room 3 purpose, criterion 12 and criterion 11 ("rooms 1–5 never more than 3").
   - `combat.md` still says the wind-up message is "a grub rears back (all variants)". `combat-step68.md` governs and the build follows it.
   - `combat-cues-visual-spec.md` says spitter cues are "normally 0.8 s apart". That is true only in room 3 and is already noted for the art director.
   - `decisions/D-007` ends with a stray `</parameter>` line, which looks like a formatting leftover.
3. **Not verified (gaps, not failures):**
   - V-c, byte-identical output to 0.6.1: no baseline in the packet.
   - V-e, "no bot result changes": no 0.6.1 bot output, and room 3 changed in the same build.
   - R3-8, the timed run to the last spitter.
   - R3-4, a direct room 3 sidestep, late dash and recovery swipe.
4. **Observations, no defect:**
   - A still player in room 3 dies at 6.3 s to three spitter shots (hits at 3.4, 5.5, 6.3 s), before the grub's first lunge. The grub only matters to a player who survives the first 6 s.
   - The D-007 simultaneous cue start now occurs at 6.0 s in the reactive run (6.8 s in QA 43). This is the same accepted cap-delay case, and the count never exceeded 5.
   - No undefined expected behavior was found, so nothing goes to Design.

## Decisions already made

- D-012 (room 3 layout), D-011 (variant messages), D-007 (room 3 bound and simultaneous cues), D-005 (blocked contact), D-001 (one-button combat). I applied them as written and changed none.

## Constraints

- Both 30 and 60 FPS were checked wherever a run was made.
- I verified from the specs, criteria and build, not from the implementer's explanations. I did not modify production code or tests.
- Bot numbers are reported without proposed values. None is outside a limit.

## Open questions

1. Can the Studio supply a 0.6.1 baseline (play output for the V-c scripts and bot output) so V-c and the "no bot result changes" part of V-e can be judged? Otherwise Studio decides whether to accept them as unverified.
2. Should the 60 FPS walker sitting at both limits (6 hearts lost, 2 rooms cleared) be watched? Any further layout change risks it. It is not a defect now.

## Expected output

**Verdict: fail** for this verification round. The reason is the red suite (a test defect), not any observed build behavior. Routing:
- Defect 1 goes to `gameplay-engineer` (Build): fix the test, which is test tooling.
- The re-verify should then close the gaps: a timed R3-8 run in room 3, direct room 3 sidestep, late-dash and recovery-swipe scripts for R3-4, and V-c / V-e if a baseline exists.
- No spec gap goes to `game-designer`, and no criterion has failed twice.
