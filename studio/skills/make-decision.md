# Skill: Make decision

Typical roles: game-director, game-designer, technical-director, art-director.

## When to use

A choice is needed and it falls within your Role's "Decides" section.

## Inputs

The options with evidence and trade-offs, the vision, constraints and existing Decisions.

## Method

1. Confirm the choice is yours. Check the escalation triggers in `studio/orchestration.md`; if one
   fires, use `prepare-owner-escalation` instead.
2. Judge on evidence and fit with the vision — not on how many opinions favor an option.
3. Decide. State the limits of the decision (what it does not cover).
4. Record a Decision (`studio/templates/decision.md`) if it constrains future work, a real
   alternative was rejected, or it changes a design document. Otherwise note it in the Handoff.

## Output

The decision in the outgoing Handoff, and a Decision file when warranted.

## Do not

Defer a decision you own to the Owner. Do not decide by vote.
